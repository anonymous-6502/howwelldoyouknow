American billionaire Michael Eisner will address fans on Thursday with details of his £5.67m offer for 100% of the promoted League Two club.Shareholders and PST members will vote on the former Walt Disney chief executive's proposals later this month."I don't think that we should think this is our only chance," Brown said.Eisner, 75, has presented the terms of his offer before a town hall-style meeting at Portsmouth's Guildhall on Thursday.Among his proposals are a further £10m equity investment, as well as the removal of three PST members from the club's nine-strong board.The PST own 48% of the club after helping bring it out of administration in 2013.Rather than instructing shareholders to vote in favour of Eisner's deal, the PST and club presidents have told fans to make up their own minds."What people need to do is see if it's the right option and the right person," Brown told BBC Radio Solent."That's the difficulty for people as you're dealing with somebody you don't know."Thursday is a chance for some people to look him in the eye in a public forum and ask him some questions and we'll see what he has got to say then."It's a huge decision about the future of the club, one that will define the path in goes on in the next few years. The beauty is that it's the fans that are making it."^Portsmouth FC and Pompey Supporters' Trust (PST) board member Ashley Brown has urged fans to make an informed choice over a proposed takeover.
Judge DW Deshpande said the actor would have to be present in the court for the judgement.Khan has been charged with culpable homicide by the Mumbai court.He recently told the court he was not driving on the night of the incident.The actor also said his driver Altaf was driving the car when the crash occurred.If convicted, he faces 10 years in prison.Late on the night of 28 September 2002, Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser rammed into the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say.The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the streets, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries.The prosecution has alleged that Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk.The actor, who has always denied the charges against him, recently told the court that he was not drunk and was not driving the car either.Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films.Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits.^A court in India will give its verdict on 6 May in a 2002 hit-and-run incident in which Bollywood star Salman Khan is accused of running over five men sleeping on a pavement, killing one of them.
The service is available to Three customers travelling to the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden and Denmark.European authorities have been clamping down on roaming charges.But Three is the first network to abolish them altogether, albeit in selected countries, where it has sister networks.Three says customers on a pay monthly contract would be able to use their allowances of free minutes, texts and data with no extra charges for being abroad.However, those on unlimited plans will be subject to some restrictions.In a press release, Thomas Malleschitz, marketing director at Three, said: "By abolishing expensive roaming charges in select countries, we are allowing our customers to get even more value from their minutes, texts and data abroad by removing the fear associated with staying in touch while travelling."Analysts say that other operators of mobile phone networks are likely to follow Three's lead, particularly those who already have a presence in other countries.Matthew Howett, a senior analyst at consultancy firm Ovum, says the deal from Three is also interesting because it applies to nations outside the European Union, where there has been pressure from authorities to lower roaming charges."Reducing roaming charges outside of that bloc will welcomed by many, since prices have remained stubbornly high in some countries," he said.^Three has announced that it has abolished international roaming charges in seven countries.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceParis Saint-Germain's £50 million defender David Luiz waved across the Parc des Princes pitch and then gestured with a thumbs up. Beaming with a bright smile I waved back immediately, then embarrassment set in.I realised the recognition wasn't for me, it was for another Ballymena man standing just to my left, the head groundsman at PSG.I was immensely proud for Jonathan Calderwood. A man raised just 'up the road' from me in Clough, County Antrim. This is a matchday ritual for Jonathan, receiving accolades from some of the world's most expensive footballers."When we played Barcelona, I was told that Messi and Neymar both said it was the best pitch they've ever played on, when we played Real Madrid in September I got the same feedback from them," he said.It all started at east Belfast club Glentoran, where Jonathan cut his teeth (and grass) at the Oval.Next stop was the old Wembley Stadium in London, which coincided with his studies at Myrescough College, where he gained a National Diploma in Turf Science.Jonathan worked his way through the ranks, ending up as deputy head groundsman at Wembley.Calderwood went on to become head groundsman at Wolverhampton Wanderers before a move to Aston Villa.During 15 successful years at Villa Park he picked up multiple turf related awards including two Premier League Groundsman of the Year trophies. At Villa he met Gerard Houillier, one of the game's most respected managers.Meanwhile, across the English Channel a group of investors from Qatar made PSG one of Europe's richest football clubs. They wanted the very best of everything, including the blades of grass on the Parc des Princes pitch.On the advice of Houllier that meant a groundsman from Clough. He told PSG that Jonathan was the best groundsman in the world and Carlo Ancelotti, their manager at that time, agreed.Jonathan and his family moved to a new life in Paris and he made an immediate impact, becoming French Groundman of the Year in his first season.He added: "When you hear someone saying 'the guy just cuts grass' it's a little bit hurtful because I know what skills are involved, what dedication, what hours, what knowledge and experience goes into having a pitch like what we have at PSG."Modern day football pitches are so complex and so complicated. I spent three years full-time at university and I would say 90% of my time was spent in the laboratory doing soil analysis, weeds, pesticides, disease management, wind, water, sunshine, fertiliser programmes and aeration - there is so much to it.'Jonathan's story doesn't end there, for his pitch will host Northern Ireland's game against Germany in Euro 2016."If you're a groundsman like me, you want to work at the very top and it doesn't come much bigger than the European Championships," he said."For me to move to Paris and for Northern Ireland to end up playing Germany in Paris on my pitch it doesn't get any better than that - it's like a dream come true."So Jonathan has already had recognition from some of the best players in the world - come 21 June he'll be hoping for a thumbs up from the likes of Steven Davis, Jonny Evans and manager Michael O'Neill.Who knows, that could be after a win over the world champions!^It was just minutes before kick-off, and that's when it happened.
Croker starts at hooker for the hosts at Twickenham, with Amy Cokayne dropping to the bench.Ciara Griffin is handed her first Six Nations start at flanker for Ireland, while Paula Fitzpatrick moves to number eight and Heather O'Brien to the bench.Experienced fly-half Nora Stapleton comes in for Nikki Caughey, who will provide back-up from the replacements.Ireland, led by Tom Tierney, defeated Wales 21-3 in their opening fixture, but went on to lose 18-6 against France in Perpignan.England won their opening two fixtures, against Scotland and Italy."Ireland is going to present a tough challenge this weekend and there will be no margin for error," said England's lead coach Scott Bemand."Recent history testifies that our games have been fiercely contested and, as a group, we are very excited to play at the home."Tierney added: "While the result in France didn't go our way, I thought there were a lot of positives to take from that game and we will be looking to carry them into this fixture."We made too many unforced errors in Perpignan, so if we can rectify that I think we have got a very good chance on Saturday."Twickenham is a special place to play, so it will be a great experience for the girls, but it is important that we go there looking to perform and hopefully come away with a result."England women: Katie Mason (Bristol); Lydia Thompson (Worcester), Lauren Cattell (Saracens), Ceri Large (Worcester), Lotte Clapp (Saracens);  Amber Reed (Bristol), La Toya Mason (Darlington Mowden Park); Rochelle Clark (Worcester), Emma Croker (Richmond), Vickii Cornborough (Richmond);  Abbie Scott (Darlington Mowden Park), Emily Braund (Lichfield); Harriet Millar-Mills (Lichfield), Izzy Noel-Smith (Bristol),  Sarah Hunter (Bristol)Replacements: Amy Cokayne (Lichfield), Heather Kerr (Darlington Mowden Park), Bee Dawson (Wasps), Tamara Taylor (Darlington Mowden Park), Poppy Leitch (Bristol), Bianca Blackburn (Worcester), Ruth Laybourn (Darlington Mowden Park), Leanne Riley (Richmond)Ireland women: Niamh Briggs (Munster); Elise O'Byrne-White (Leinster), Aine Donnelly (Leinster), Sene Naoupu (Connacht), Mairead Coyne (Connacht); Nora Stapleton (Leinster), Larissa Muldoon (Skewen); Ruth O'Reilly (Connacht), Cliodhna Moloney (Leinster), Ailis Egan (Leinster); Sophie Spence (Leinster), Marie Louise Reilly (Leinster), Ciara Griffin (Munster), Claire Molloy (Bristol), Paula Fitzpatrick (Toulouse).Replacements: Zoe Grattage (Munster), Fiona Hayes (Munster), Fiona Reidy (Munster), Ciara Cooney (Leinster), Heather O'Brien (Toulouse), Mary Healy (Connacht), Nikki Caughey (Ulster), Jackie Shiels (Richmond).^England have brought in Emma Croker and have Ireland made two changes for Saturday's Women's Six Nations game.
The incident happened on Tuesday night, when the attacker charged at Rajnish Thakur in his shop in Mumbai's Chembur neighbourhood.Naseeruddin Mansuri, who was a customer in the shop, has been hailed a hero for rushing to defend Mr Thakur.But Mr Mansuri told BBC Hindi that he now fears for his life.He has asked journalists not to take photos of him."I have a wife and children. If some criminal recognises me from photo and comes after me, who will protect me? Please don't create any trouble for me," he pleaded.Speaking about the incident, Mr Mansuri told the BBC: "For a moment, I couldn't understand what was happening. But then I managed to stop the attacker and also started shouting so more people gathered."Mr Mansuri said he did not feel any fear. "At that time I had to just save this man... How could I watch someone being beaten up?"After the video was shown on Indian television channels and posted online, Mr Mansuri was hailed as a hero on social media.But, he says he has received threats and is worried about his family and has not left home since after the incident.Police have arrested the attacker and named him as Akram Sheikh.Reports say Mr Thakur was attacked because he has been actively campaigning against extortion by the underworld.^Video footage has emerged of an Indian man fighting a sword-wielding attacker to save the life of a shopkeeper.
Lego refused a bulk order for bricks that were to be used in a new artwork about political dissidents as part of an exhibition in Melbourne, Australia.Toymaker Lego said it never sold directly to anyone wanting to use its product to make a political statement.The artist has since been deluged with offers of Lego from supporters.Ai used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, on the site of the former Alcatraz prison near San Francisco.He planned a similar work for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but a bulk order placed by the museum was rejected by the Danish company.The Chinese artist said the company told the museum its bricks could not be used for artworks containing "any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements".Referring to The Lego Movie's slogan "everything is awesome", Ai wrote on Twitter: "Lego will tell us what to do, or not to do. That is awesome!"He added: "Lego is giving us the definition of what is 'political', and all the big corporations are telling us what to love or hate. That is awesome."In an Instagram post, he wrote: "As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe."As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values."Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination."Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek would not comment directly on the case but said that, as a principle, Lego "respects any individual's right to free, creative expression".But he added that the company had a long-standing policy not to directly sell to anyone if it knew that its bricks would be used to make a political statement.The artist also linked Lego's stance with plans for a new Legoland in Shanghai.Lego said the theme park was being built by Merlin Entertainment and not Lego, but that Lego does have some ties with Merlin because it uses the Lego brand.Ai Weiwei is known for his criticism of the Chinese government as well as for being one of the world's leading contemporary artists.He was arrested during a crackdown on political activists in China in 2011 and was released without charge after 81 days. The Chinese authorities kept his passport for four years, but it was returned earlier this year.^Artist Ai Weiwei has accused Lego of "censorship and discrimination" after the company refused to allow him to use its bricks in a new exhibition.
Several fire appliances were called to the scene at Carnsalloch House to tackle the blaze.One witness reported damage to the main part of the house at Kirkton, with floors and the roof burnt out.The category A listed building had fallen into a state of disrepair and had been described as a target for vandals, fireraisers and drug-users.The mansion house at Kirkton was built in the middle of the 18th Century, with a number of extensions added over the years.From the late 1960s until about 2000 it was owned by the Leonard Cheshire foundation.Plans for a housing development at the site were rejected and earlier this month the developers sought a council review of the decision.^A derelict historic house near Dumfries has been damaged in a fire which broke out overnight on Friday.
Starr, a former independent counsel, was the author of what's probably the most expensive piece of pornography ever published, the Starr Report which chronicled, in graphic sexual detail, Bill Clinton's affair with a 21-year-old White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.The one-time character assassin has become a character witness.Bill Clinton, despite being impeached for lying under oath about that affair, left office with the highest approval rating - 66% - of any departing president.He was also credited with balancing the federal budget and reviving the American economy from its early-Nineties slump.Since then, as Starr noted, he has followed a redemptive path. So he should be a prime asset to his wife Hillary as she seeks to become the first ever first lady to move from the East Wing of the White House to the West.The irony of Starr's kind words is that they have come at a time when Hillary, among other woes, has a Bill problem. The man who could well become the "First Dude" - Hillary's words, not mine - is proving to be something of a liability.Part of it stems, of course, from what eventually became the focus of Kenneth Starr's inquiry, Bill Clinton's womanising.It blunts her attacks on Donald Trump's sexism and misogyny which, in a contest where more women will vote than men, should have been her ace card.The billionaire, in a jujutsu-like move, has already launched an attack ad featuring video of Kathleen Willey, who accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, and Juanita Broaddrick, who accused him of rape."DIRTY BILLS," read the front page of the New York Post the following day, conflating Trump's attack ad with the allegations against Bill Cosby.Nor is Trump relying on guilt by association. He has already called Hillary an "enabler" of her husband's fidelity. "She would go after these women and destroy their lives," he has claimed.Like many of Trump's attacks, that may strike many voters as shrill and overstated, it also contains a kernel of truth.The White House did attempt to trash Monica Lewinsky when the scandal first erupted in 1998, and Hillary Clinton, during her husband's long phase of public denial, described it as being the product of a "vast right-wing conspiracy", absolving him of blame.Hillary as loyal "stand-by-your-man" wife does not marry that well with Hillary as feminist trailblazer, the image she is trying to project.My sense, having watched the Clintons fairly closely for over 20 years, is that they have a loving marriage and deep friendship. An animated conversation that started at Yale Law School in the early Seventies continues for both of them to fascinate and enthral.But many critics of the Clintons believe it's a transactional partnership, a marriage of political convenience. To some, her loyalty during the most troubled phase of the Clinton presidency reinforces the sense that she's a cynical political operator, willing to do anything to accrue power.The Bernie problem, her difficulty in seeing off her Democratic rival, is also partly a Bill problem. The unexpected success of the Vermont Senator is explained not only by an aversion to Hillary but also a rejection of Bill.Sanders supporters are railing against his political and policy legacy. Bill Clinton's pursuit of a "Third Way" politics was designed to make the Democrats more electable and to end the party's losing streak in presidential politics.Up until his victory in 1992, they had only won one of the previous six elections. But this shift to the middle ground, and the centrist policies that accompanied it, alienated many on the Democrat left. Withholding support from Hillary Clinton and bestowing it instead upon Bernie Sanders is a form of revenge.Whether its financial deregulation, the welfare bill that Clinton passed with the Republican-controlled Congress, criminal justice reforms which have contributed to higher levels of black incarceration, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta for short, there's been an angry backlash against what Clinton once trumpeted as some of his greatest domestic accomplishments.This has made her vulnerable to a challenge from the left, as Sanders has shown. But it also makes her vulnerable to a challenge from the right, because of Nafta.Blue-collar voters, who might ordinarily be expected to vote Democrat, stand to applaud when Donald Trump promises to renegotiate trade deals which have exported American jobs abroad.Hillary Clinton hinted recently that Bill would become her jobs tsar and focus his energies on reviving American manufacturing.She clearly hopes that he can appeal again to blue-collar whites, who warmed to him as a candidate and president. But that bond has been severely eroded, if not severed completely, because he was the president who negotiated Nafta.Public perceptions about Bill Clinton have also changed, in a way which exposes the rupture between the Democratic establishment and the Democratic grassroots.When he first appeared on the national scene, he could plausibly cast himself as the boy from Hope, his small-town Arkansas birthplace.Now, after all the millions he has earned on the international speaking circuit, he comes across not just as a limousine liberal but a Lear Jet liberal. Standing at the head of a metropolitan progressive elite, he does not have the same common touch of old.The Clintons, after all these years as the dominant power couple in the Democratic establishment, also project an imperious sense of entitlement. It explains why Hillary Clinton's email scandal cuts so deep. It reinforces the widespread view that the couple believe they are not bound by normal rules.Are Trump and Sanders right about trade?Why is the US turning to protectionism?Trump, Clinton and the 'None of the Above' eraHillary Clinton's problem with womenThose of us who have watched him on the campaign trail have also been surprised at the 69-year-old's comparative lack of energy.  The magnetism and charisma for which he is famed simply is not there.At a rally in New Hampshire, I happened to be stood next to Clinton's biographer David Maraniss, whose real-time Twitter feed made for fascinating reading."When BC was introduced and stood on stage w/Chelsea, he showed nothing on his face, mouth agape, eyes seemingly blank... just frail, like he had to conserve every ounce of energy. No gleam in his eyes, no electricity, mutedâ€¦. He lit up only when Chelsea talked about him. Then when it was his turn to talk a little bit of his old self came back, but not much."Once the most powerful energy force in any room, Bill Clinton is now only an ambient presence.The former president is not without his fans. There are thousands who still cheer this self-proclaimed architect of the bridge to the 21st Century. What's also been striking is how African-American voters have returned to the Clinton fold, after backing Barack Obama in 2008, despite protesters from the Black Lives Matters campaign targeting him on the stump.However, the former first couple's hopes that wistful memories of the Clinton administration would lead to a Clinton restoration have surely dwindled.Nostalgia is something that can give a departing president a warm glow, as Barack Obama is presently discovering, but hard for a presidential aspirant to harness, especially when so much of the country is angrily demanding change.^Adding another unanticipated sidebar to this topsy-turvy election, Kenneth Starr has lavished praise on Bill Clinton, citing his "genuine empathy for human beings", calling him "the most gifted politician of the baby boomer generation" and commending his post-presidential philanthropy, which he noted was Carteresque in its benevolence.
The twin-engined CN235 transport plane came down in a rural area near the town of Codazzi, in Cesar province, having reported engine difficulties.Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos described the victims as heroes.An investigation into the cause of the crash has been ordered, says the commander of Colombia's air force, Gen Carlos Bueno.Colombian media reported (in Spanish) that local residents said the plane had been struck by lightning.All of those killed were members of the Colombian air force.The CN235 is manufactured by Airbus, who said in a statement that the plane concerned was produced in 1998 in Seville.^A Colombian air force plane has crashed in the north of the country, killing all 11 of those on board.
Alasdair McCrone, of Mull Theatre, and Gordon McLean, of the arts centre An Tobar, were among three directors of the umbrella body Comar.It looks after a number of arts organisations on the island.Comar's board said funding restrictions made it necessary to reduce three posts to one.It said the three existing directorial posts - in theatre/dance, visual arts/film and music/literature - would be replaced by one artistic director who would lead the entire creative programmeComar, which was created two years ago, said it hoped to continue to work with both Mr McCrone and McLean.Equity blames poor business planning and is calling on the board to resign.A public meeting about the decision is to be held in Tobermory next week.High-profile Scottish actor Alan Cumming tweeted: "This makes me so sad.  Another example of the accountants take over at the expense of the art. And in Mull too."Former Scottish culture secretary and SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, Michael Russell, tweeted: "Making Alasdair & Gordon redundant is an extraordinary wrong-headed decision and must be opposed."^The actors' union Equity has hit out at the decision to remove two of Mull's best-known creative directors from their posts.
Inspired by the lily pond in Monet's garden at Giverny in France, the painting was the top lot at Sotheby's sale of modern and impressionist works.It totalled just under £122m, including £15.2m for Piet Mondrian's 1927 Composition with Red, Blue and Grey.Sotheby's said it proved collectors are still keen to acquire "trophy art".Paintings by Sisley, Picasso, Manet and Kandinsky were also among the 46 works, with only four pieces failing to find buyers as many sold close to the top end of the pre-auction estimates and sometimes above."The Nympheas selling for such a huge sum is again a reflection that this is still a market that is driven by trophies, that the great works by the major masters are still really sought after," said Philip Hook from Sotheby's.The auction house said the bidding for the Monet work attracted buyers from Asia and all over the world and went on for 10 minutes, going up in £250,000 increments in its final stages.It said the painting, from the "most iconic and celebrated of Monet's painting series, can be counted among the artist's greatest achievements".It once belonged to Paul Durand-Ruel, the legendary art dealer who championed the Impressionists and represented Monet.The same work had been offered for auction in 2010 but failed to reach its reserve price. Sotheby's said this time it had carried a more "realistic" estimate of £20m to £30m.The sale price of £31.7m included a buyer's premium.Two other Monet paintings were also offered in the sale, La Seine a Argenteuil which sold for £8.5m and Antibes, vue du plateau Notre-Dame, which sold for £7.9m.^A 1906 Claude Monet water lilies painting, Nympheas, has sold for £31.7m in London, the second highest price ever paid for the artist at an auction.
Five justices in the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge for an inquiry into the shootings at Batang Kali in 1948 by a four to one majority.The families, who say the men were "massacred", had their case rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last year.British forces at the time of the killings said the men were insurgents.In the Supreme Court panel's judgement, one of the justices, Lord Kerr, described the case as "shocking" and said the "overwhelming preponderance of currently available evidence" showed "wholly innocent men were mercilessly murdered".He said it was "with regret" that he dismissed the appeal."This is an instance where the law has proved itself unable to respond positively to the demand that there be redress for the historical wrong that the appellants so passionately believe has been perpetrated on them and their relatives," Lord Kerr said."That may reflect a deficiency in our system of law. It certainly does not represent any discredit on the honourable crusade that the appellants have pursued."Another of the justices, Lady Hale, said she would have allowed the appeal and said the UK government "did not seriously consider the most cost-effective form which such an inquiry might take"."They did not seriously consider the "bigger picture": the public interest in properly inquiring into an event of this magnitude; the private interests of the relatives and survivors in knowing the truth and seeing the reputations of their deceased relatives vindicated," she said.The appellants in the case - Chong Nyok Keyu, Loh Ah Choi, Lim Kok and Wooi Kum Thai, two of whom were at Batang Kali as children - were supported by the action group Condemning The Batang Kali Massacre, a campaign in Malaysia that includes 568 civil society organisations.Michael Fordham QC, representing the appellants, told the court that the families wished to "vindicate the legitimate interests of the deceased, in order to achieve justice, before they die themselves".Relatives argued that Article 2 - the right to life - of the European Convention on Human Rights imposes a duty on the UK to commission an independent inquiry, despite the killings occurring before the convention was drafted and signed.It was argued on behalf of the government that the Human Rights Act "does not have retrospective effect and does not impose an obligation to hold an inquiry into deaths occurring several decades before it came into force".The account of the British authorities at the time was that the deceased were justifiably shot while they were attempting to escape from the patrol.An official explanation was contained in a written parliamentary answer in Hansard, published on 26 January 1949.On 11 and 12 December 1948 - when Malaya was still a British colony - 24 villagers were killed by a platoon of Scots Guards during a raid at Batang Kali.The men were Chinese migrant workers suspected by the British of helping rebels during the Malayan Emergency - a conflict between communist guerrillas and British and Commonwealth forces, which lasted 12 years.An investigation at the time cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing, but in 1970 some of the soldiers said the villagers had been executed.In the 1990s, authorities in Malaysia opened an investigation, but it was halted before a conclusion was reached.There have been numerous calls for a public inquiry - all of which have been rejected by the UK.^Relatives of 24 rubber plantation workers killed by British troops almost 70 years ago in Malaya have lost an appeal for an official investigation.
The company said it was looking at the possibility of adding services between Sandown and Southsea.It said the idea had come from businesses at the island resort who were keen to boost tourism.If confirmed, the cross-Solent service would operate on two days a week in July and August.Neil Chapman, managing director of Hovertravel, said: "We're always open to new ideas which might boost tourism to the Isle of Wight and we provisionally agreed the concept, subject to gaining the appropriate permissions."The plan would be for the service to operate four 25-minute crossings every Tuesday and Thursday from 14 July to 27 August.The Isle of Wight Council welcomed the plan and said it was currently in discussion with Hovertravel to finalise the details and the use of Sandown Beach for the service.^A new hovercraft route between the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth could be introduced in the summer, operator Hovertravel has said.
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, was airlifted to hospital but later died. Her daughter Olivia, eight, was also injured in the incident on The Kingsway on 31 March.Her family described her as "an outgoing, hard working and loving person."A coroner has called on Swansea council to address safety concerns on the road.In a tribute they wrote: "Our family is absolutely devastated at the tragic accident, which took Louise from us all last week."We've lost a beautiful loving wife, mum, daughter and sister who will never be forgotten."Louise was an outgoing, hard working and loving person. An incredible hole has been left in our family which can never be filled."The family thanked staff at Swansea's Morriston hospital who treated the mother-of-three and her daughter.They also paid tribute to police, members of the public and staff from the Principality building society who looked after Olivia after the incident.After the crash, Swansea council said it would install temporary barriers along the central reservation of the road.It has already dropped the speed limit to 20mph following concerns from residents that the road was unsafe.In a letter to the council, Swansea's acting senior coroner Colin Phillips said the road had a "serious design issue", which "must be addressed".Mr Phillips issued the report as part of his investigation into the death of Daniel Foss, 37, who died after being hit by a bus on The Kingsway in September 2013.^The family of an off-duty police officer who died after being hit by a bus in Swansea say her death has left a hole that can never be filled.
Derby City Council wanted to shut Moorways Pool from April in a bid to save about Â£350,000 a year.The Labour-led authority, which needs to save Â£79m over the next three years, said it had found the savings by making cuts in other areas.Campaigners who gathered more than 4,000 signatures on a petition said they were delighted at the news.Ranjit Banwait, leader of the authority, said the council had committed to keep it open for a year.He said the council had identified savings "in back-office areas" and a restructuring of management jobs, which had been "untouched" since 2010.However, he stressed if the authority failed to get a "fair deal" from central government in the future, the pool would still have to close.Campaigners had accepted the pool, which is 33m in length, was in need of repair.There are plans for a new 50m pool to be built by 2018 to replace it.However, closing it would have left only one other public pool in the city - the Queen's Leisure Centre, they said.Doug Whitlam, of the Derbyshire Amateur Swimming Association, said: "One of the main things for me would have been the loss of teaching."Twelve hundred young people use this facility every week and that would be lost forever."^A Derby swimming pool threatened with closure is to remain open for another year, council bosses have confirmed.
He made the pledge in a Ramadan message to Muslims, who have been worst affected by the ban.The government shut 13 Somalia-linked firms in April, saying it wanted to prevent militant Islamists from using them to finance attacks.Kenyans Somalis accused the government of blanket punishment.Somalis around the world rely heavily on the firms to do business and send cash to relatives in Somalia, where the banking sector is almost non-existent.Mr Kenyatta, in his message to mark the Islamic holy month, said he had noted proposals to lift the ban on the firms.He had therefore directed the central bank to "immediately issue comprehensive regulations" for the activities of the firms, "upon which their suspension would be lifted".The ban was imposed after Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabab killed 148 people in an attack on Garissa University College in north-eastern Kenya.There has been a similar crackdown on the companies in the UK and US where the governments have adopted strict money-laundering laws making it difficult for banks to deal with them.The United Nations estimates that Somalis in the diaspora, almost all of whom are Muslim, send home about $1.6bn (Â£1.1bn) annually, significantly more than foreign aid.More than 40% of Somalis receive remittances, the bulk of which are used for basic needs, including food, clothes, medicine and education, according to a UN survey.Somalia has not had a functioning government since the fall of Siad Barre's government in 1991, and has been beset by religious and clan conflicts.^Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has said that money transfer firms will be unbanned, once the central bank unveils new guidelines for their activities.
Negotiators for the two sides at peace talks in Cuba said they would ask the UN to send a 12-month mission to oversee any ceasefire.The UN has yet to agree to the proposal. The two sides have been holding peace talks for three years.Both sides say they hope to reach a final peace deal by March 2016.The BBC's Colombia correspondent Natalio Cosoy says the mechanism would only start to work once a final deal is agreed.However both sides have insisted the announcement is more than a mere formality, suggesting it should be read as a signal that a definite deal is close, our correspondent adds."We have decided to ask the UN Security Council to create (a mission) of unarmed observers for a period of 12 months," the two sides said in a joint statement at peace talks in the Cuban capital, Havana, on Tuesday.They said the mission would guarantee that any ceasefire and disarmament would be genuine and permanent, reports say.Humberto de la Calle, the government's lead negotiator, described the announcement as a "transcendental" moment.He said it was an "unequivocal demonstration of our desire to end confrontation", according to the Associated Press.The joint announcement in Havana is a clear indication that the Colombian peace process is moving towards its final phase.Since the negotiations were launched in November 2012, the Farc has announced several unilateral ceasefires and urged the government to do the same.But even though the government has scaled down military operations recently, it has refused to join the Farc in a bilateral ceasefire.President Juan Manuel Santos has said repeatedly that the rebels must first agree to lay down their weapons and give up their armed struggle.Government and negotiators have now invited the UN Security Council to join them as an honest, reliable broker and oversee the end of the conflict.The two sides have invested too much politically to let more than three years of negotiations fail at such a late stage, when difficult issues such as justice for the victims have been dealt with.The Farc and the Colombian government seem to be working together now towards a safe, smooth landing.An estimated 220,000 people have been killed in the fighting between Farc and the Colombian military, which began in 1964. It is the longest-running armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere.Since official peace talks started in Havana in November 2012, negotiators have reached agreement on key issues such as the political participation of the rebels, land rights, drug trafficking and transitional justice.However it is unclear whether a final deal can be reached by the 23 March deadline set last year.In September, President Juan Manuel Santos and Farc chief Timoleon Jimenez, known as Timochenko, said they wanted an agreement within six months.But the Farc said last week that "substantial hurdles" were putting the deadline under threat.The request for a UN mission comes two days after Cuban President Raul Castro met with negotiators from both sides of the conflict.^The Colombian government and the left-wing Farc rebel movement have both asked the UN for a mission to oversee the end of their decades-long conflict.
Washing his own training kit and playing on sloping pitches is a world away from the life to which he had become accustomed during his career, much of which was spent in England's top two divisions.As recently as March, the 32-year-old was scoring goals in the Championship in front of thousands, but on Saturday he could take to the pitch in front of hundreds as Conference South side Maidenhead host Gosport Borough in the FA Cup third qualifying round.But Campbell will not be turning out for a team that plays in the sixth tier of English football because his career is on a downward spiral.The former Birmingham and Queens Park Rangers player is at Maidenhead to rediscover his love for the game, having come close to retiring after being wrongly implicated in a match-fixing scandal.The toughest period of his career began one December morning last year, when a knock at the door at Campbell's home preceded a dramatic arrest in front of his family, and did not end until nine months later when he was finally cleared of any wrongdoing."The whole situation was a joke and obviously depressing," says Campbell."It was difficult because after all I had worked for, it tarnished my name and even now you still have managers saying this and that."But I can't change any of that, all I can do is focus on getting back to where I was. Hopefully I can do that."Campbell was one of six people arrested in connection with allegations of fixing in football matches, which came after ex-Portsmouth defender Sam Sodje allegedly told an undercover newspaper reporter he could arrange yellow and red cards in exchange for cash. Sodje was later cleared.Released on bail following his arrest, Campbell tried to focus on his football, but he was loaned by Blackburn to Millwall in January before leaving the Ewood Park club by mutual consent in July.It was the culmination of a difficult time in Campbell's life.Having climbed from non-league to the Premier League with Birmingham, QPR and Blackpool, an increasing number of injuries in recent years - coupled with the spectre of the match-fixing allegations hanging over him - almost became too much for Campbell."It was all new things to deal with and my dad passed at the same time while the match-fixing rubbish came up, so it was a lot to handle," he says."I got to the point where I thought 'what is the point?' I didn't need all these problems and for what?"But at the same time I reflected on my career."I had done a lot to come from nothing and really make something of myself, why would I throw it all away because of this?"There were plenty of people in a worse position than me who would love to play football, so I just decided to get on with it and do what I love."After leaving Blackburn, Campbell hired a personal trainer and took to training on his own in a park.It was during that time he received a call from current Maidenhead boss Johnson Hippolyte - Campbell's friend, mentor and former manager at non-league Yeading, one of the striker's first clubs, over a decade ago.Campbell credits Hippolyte, "Drax" to those who know him, as the man who kick-started his career, having convinced him not to quit football as a teenager after being released by Aston Villa.Consequently, when Hippolyte made a tongue-in-cheek comment about joining Maidenhead, Campbell took it more seriously."I was waiting for the right club to come along," continues Campbell. "But as time went by I thought about it more and more, and in the end thought 'why not?'"The move will have surprised a lot of people but if there was anyone I was going to play for at this level it would be Drax, we have a lot of history together."There was, though, the issue of wages. Maidenhead clearly had no chance of offering Campbell the kind of money he had been accustomed to during his Premier League and Championship days.But the discussion never came up."It is not all about the money," Campbell says. "It is about being happy and I have not been happy the last few years with all that has gone on."It is easy to think all footballers are motivated by money, and I could have signed for a club and just sat on the bench and taken a wage but I decided not to do that."I've decided to play for Drax and get back to doing what I love doing."Hippolyte adds: "He is not getting paid at all."The players were really keen for him to stay and play for Maidenhead when he was initially just training with us, so much so that they offered a whip-round for him."But it was never about the money for DJ, he just wants to play and enjoy himself again, and we want for him to show that he is still hungry and still has the ability."That ability is clearly still there.In front of a crowd of about 400, Campbell scored on his debut last month as Maidenhead beat Faversham Town 4-0 to progress to the FA Cup third qualifying round.To grab a goal in the competition, with Hippolyte watching on from the dugout, will reignite memories of the famous FA Cup run the pair enjoyed at Yeading back in the 2004-05 season.Campbell scored seven goals in the competition to help Yeading reach the third round, where they lost 2-0 to Newcastle.But, having held out impressively for 50 minutes against the Premier League side, with the game broadcast to millions on BBC One, Campbell caught the eye, with Brentford giving the then 24-year-old his first chance in professional football.From then on he flourished, scoring 12 goals in six months - including a double in a 2-1 win against Sunderland in the FA Cup which earned him a move to Birmingham City, then playing in the Premier League."The FA Cup really put me in the shop window," remembers Campbell."It made me get noticed because in those days it was tough for non-league players, not many got the chance they seem to do now."My form in the competition helped get me my move to Brentford. I continued to score lots there and Birmingham manager Steve Bruce was in the crowd when we played Sunderland in the FA Cup."I think he was looking at another player, but I scored twice and caught his eye, so that was a blessing."With just two qualifying rounds remaining in this season's competition before the first round proper, Campbell hopes to be able to score the goals that could help Maidenhead replicate Yeading's famous FA Cup run from a decade ago.But regardless of whether the Magpies can achieve that, Hippolyte, remembering the talented 16-year-old he first spotted playing in a park near his home, hopes Campbell will not be around long enough to be part of it."I really wish Saturday is his last game," he says."In a perfect world he will play for us, score in the FA Cup and get us through and get his move on Monday."As much as I would love to keep him here, as a father figure he should not be playing anywhere near this level."Considering the FA Cup arguably made his career in professional football, it would only be fitting if the competition now resurrected it.^When DJ Campbell stepped out onto the Ewood Park pitch for Blackburn in October 2013, the striker - then earning a reported £25,000 a week - did not expect he would be playing for free at non-league side Maidenhead United barely 12 months later.
In the three months to June 2014, there were 960 initial decisions to place a child for adoption, compared with 1,830 in the three months to September 2013.The figures were released by the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB).The ALB says the drop in adoptions may have been influenced by recent court judgements in care and adoption cases.The board, which was established by the government as part of a shake-up of the adoption system, said applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption had fallen by 34%.There had also been a fall of 54% in the number of placement orders granted by courts, from 1,650 to 750, it said.In recent years, adoption figures had risen to record levels, with an increase of 63%, the ALB said.But last September, the most senior family court judge criticised the "sloppy practice" of social workers when bringing cases for adoption before the courts and said they were not looking closely enough at all the other options.President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, also implied that, at a time of tight budgets, adoption may be seen as a cheaper option than helping troubled families or foster carers and warned about "resource issues" affecting local authorities' thinking.He said there had been four cases during 10 days in July alone in which judges had expressed concerns about inadequate analysis by social services  in support of the case for adoption.ALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, said these court judgements had been "entirely sensible".But he warned that they were being misinterpreted by local authorities who thought the law on adoption had changed.He told the BBC that the recent drop in children being put forward for adoption was primarily due to fewer local authorities deciding adoption was the best option for a child."It's then been compounded by the refusal of some applications at the court," he said.Sir Martin said some councils seemed to have taken some court rulings to mean that if a child could remain in foster care, then "that will do", when in fact the best interests of the child must be pursued.Sir Martin said the drop followed two years of significant progress in finding more adoptive homes for the thousands of children waiting.The number of children adopted across the UK has risen from 3,100 in 2011 to  5,050 in the last year.The recent fall in children being put forward for adoption in England  has prompted  Sir Martin to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of recent court judgements."It is clear from my discussions with social workers and managers in local authorities and in voluntary adoption agencies that there is a belief that the law has been fundamentally changed by a number of court judgements."So I am pleased to produce this simple myth-busting guide - drafted by a senior queen's counsel - to what those judgements do and do not say."I am extremely grateful to Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, for his advice. He has seen the document and is supportive of its aim of dispelling the myths that have arisen."Messages included in Sir Martin's guidance reiterated that the legal test for adoption had not changed, and courts must be provided with expert, high quality, evidence-based analysis of all realistic options for a child and the arguments for and against each of these.Sir Martin said: "The board and I have published this guide to help everyone working for children understand the law around these complex cases, and be confident in making the right decisions for the child."^The number of children put forward for adoption by local councils in England has fallen by almost half in under a year, the latest figures show.
Police were called to the property in Thornhill Road at about 11:00 on Saturday following the discovery of the body.The death is being treated as unexplained and a post-mortem examination will be held to establish the cause.A Police Scotland spokesman said a disturbance had earlier been heard in the block of flats.Forensic examinations are taking place at the scene and there is an increased police presence in the area.Officers are appealing for any witnesses who may have been in the Thornhill Road area between 17:00 on Friday and 11:00 on Saturday to come forward.Det Ch Insp Jim Smith said:  "This is a heartbreaking time for the deceased's family and they are being supported by officers at this time."We are aware that sounds of a disturbance were heard within a block of flats in Thornhill Road and are keen to hear from anyone who was in that area during the evening of Friday 10th April and into the early hours of Saturday 11th April."Anyone who saw or heard anything that was out of the ordinary is asked to contact Police Scotland immediately."^The body of a 30-year-old man has been found at a flat in Falkirk.
The traditional turkey meals are for patients, but tens of thousands of staff working on the big day will tuck in to their dinner in a hospital canteen.Across the UK, 12,000 midwives will have to time theirs around delivering 1,800 Christmas babies.At care homes in England there will be 200,000 staff sitting down to eat during a break in their shift.Lane House Residential Care Home in Tamworth will be serving turkey with all the trimmings, including roast and mashed potatoes, stuffing, carrots, parsnips, peas, sprouts and cranberry sauce, followed by Christmas pudding served with either custard or brandy sauce.After lunch there will be a 'film afternoon' for the residents, along with a buffet tea of finger sandwiches, scotch eggs, sausage rolls, pork pies and mince pies.At University College Hospital London it will be "business as usual", but with some extra Christmas magic.Ana Veloso, nursing assistant in the acute medical unit, said: "Christmas Day is extra-special.  We put up decorations, the nurses wear hats and earrings, and the patients are given presents."At Alder Hey children's hospital in Liverpool. Father Christmas will be paying a visit to the ward.Val Shannon, voluntary services manager at Alder Hey, said: "Christmas should always be special for children and our staff will do everything possible to make Christmas Day as magical as possible for our patients, many of whom are very poorly."Father Christmas will visit our wards on Christmas morning and every child in the hospital will receive a sack full of presents."There is also a traditional Christmas lunch, prepared by our ward-based chefs and complete with Christmas crackers. We also try to ensure our patients' families have a special day too, by giving out toys to siblings and providing parents with vouchers for a free meal in the hospital restaurant."^The NHS will serve more than 400,000 lunches on Christmas Day in the UK.
Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.“Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?”This appeared to be an impossible demand.Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece.The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then.Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.^Ten years ago I was running from San Francisco’s Moscone Centre to a nearby hotel to edit a piece for the Ten O’Clock News when my phone rang.
Mr Obama asked Congress for the funds after a week of nationwide protests over perceived policing injustices.Ferguson in Missouri was rocked by riots after a grand jury decided not to charge a white police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man.Protests spread across the US and a mass walkout was held on Monday.Students and workers held a lunchtime protest in several cities to highlight the issue."This is not a problem just of Ferguson, Missouri. This is a national problem, Mr Obama said. "But it's a solvable problem."The president spoke after a day of meetings with mayors, civil rights leaders and law enforcement officials at the White House.They discussed a programme that currently provides redundant US military tactical gear to local police departments, free of charge.Mr Obama said he has asked federal agencies for recommendations to ensure the programme is not building a "militarised culture" in domestic police forces.Police in Ferguson, Missouri, were criticised for being heavy-handed in dealing with protests sparked by the shooting of Michael Brown in August.The funds requested by Mr Obama would be spread over three years and some of the money will go towards purchasing 50,000 body cameras for police officers as well as resources to reform law enforcement departments.Body cameras can provide evidence of encounters between police and civilians, particularly in disputed cases such as the Ferguson shooting.The president said the stories of discrimination that young people had told him at the White House on Monday "violate my belief about what America can do".He also unveiled a taskforce on modern policing, to be chaired by Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey.Also on Monday, a commission tasked with making recommendations on issues stemming from the fatal shooting has convened in Ferguson.The 16-member panel, stood up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, will consider changes in areas including public interaction with law enforcement and community stability.The officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend.The decision not to charge Mr Wilson days earlier triggered a nationwide debate over relations between black communities and law enforcement.The policeman said he had feared for his life.Brown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot. Some witnesses said the 18-year-old, who was unarmed, had his hands up.^US President Barack Obama has requested $263m (Â£167m) to improve police training, pay for body cameras and restore trust in policing.
Such values are ill-defined and vulnerable to misinterpretation, argued Southend head teacher, Robin Bevan.The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) voted to monitor the policing of the requirement, introduced in England by the government last year.Mr Bevan said he had concerns about how the values "might be interpreted by a future right-wing government"."When it comes to the new requirement of promoting fundamental British values, including the role of law, here is one law that I would actively encourage you to disengage from", Mr Bevan, head of Southend High School for Boys, urged the union's annual conference in Liverpool.The government brought in the requirement in the wake of the Trojan Horse allegations, which suggested there had been attempts by groups of hardline Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham.Earlier this month a committee of MPs said that apart from one incident in one school "no evidence of extremism or radicalisation was found by any of the inquiries in any of the schools involved".Requiring schools to promote "fundamental British values" could have "unintended consequences", according to the text of the motion debated by the conference in Liverpool."There is no one in this hall who would argue against the important role that schools and colleges play in promoting personal morality, in developing a sense of civic duty, in fostering engagement with our democratic structures or in embracing a wider global understanding," said Mr Bevan.He said schools and colleges had, for a long time, been required to deliver a broad and balanced curriculum addressing issues of behaviour and conduct and placing this within a developmental framework of spiritual, moral and cultural understanding."These provisions have existed without controversy for many years and are ample and effective."He accused the rules on British values as "deeply ill-considered" and "political posturing"."In what way do fundamental British values differ, for example, from French or Swedish ones?"They change over time, with women now "allowed" the vote, said Mr Bevan."If these fundamental British values change over time, we can hardly describe them as fundamental."But, he argued, the problem was not just one of definition."Just take one moment to imagine how fundamental British values might be interpreted by a future right-wing government, or a partner in that government."He said he was particularly concerned that Ofsted was being asked to gauge the views of students in order to assess how how well schools actively promote these values.There had already been cases of "less-skilled inspectors" doing this in a "wholly-inappropriate way", he told journalists later.In particular he was concerned about the difference between "what is taught and what is learned", with a proportion of every class apt to misunderstand or ignore lessons, be they about trigonometry or British values."I am not sure the government should ever be in the business of dictating values that should be taught in schools - but students should engage in those debates... plurality, that's the way it should be," said Mr Bevan.^Teachers should ignore rules on promoting "fundamental British values", a teachers' union conference has heard.
The victim was discovered with head and facial injuries in a bedroom of the flat in Ross House, Mount Vernon, on Monday morning.The woman, who is 41, has also been charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.She is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday.^A woman has been charged with attempted murder after a 24-year-old man was found critically injured at a flat in north Belfast earlier this week.
"I can't read anymore," she told the Hollywood Reporter. "I can't paint like I used to. I try to watch movies, but it's quite difficult."But these are all of the negatives," she added. "What I can do, I do. And I somehow get by."The actress, 79, has age-related macular degeneration (AMD).The condition, which affects more than 600,000 people in the UK, is the cause of more than half of the registrations for blind and partially sighted people in the country.Dame Judi first revealed her diagnosis in 2012, noting her mother had suffered from the same condition.But even before her eyesight began to decline, the Oscar-winner said she preferred to have scripts read aloud to her, as Steve Coogan did for the Oscar-nominated Philomena."I suppose it's the child in me," she said. "I think somebody coming around and telling you a story is irresistible."The actress said she had no plans to step away from the stage or the camera, calling retirement "the rudest word in my dictionary"."And 'old' is another one. I don't allow that in my house. And being called 'vintage'. I don't want any of those old words."I like 'enthusiastic' and I like the word 'cut' because that means you've finished the shot."Dame Judi made her professional acting debut at the Old Vic in 1957 and was an acclaimed stage and TV actress before being cast as M in the rejuvenated James Bond franchise in 1995.Two years later, she appeared as Queen Victoria in the TV drama Mrs Brown, which was picked up by film studio Miramax and became a global box office hit.The film kick-started her Hollywood career, and the relationship with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein brought Dame Judi her only Oscar to date, for an eight-minute cameo as Queen Elizabeth in the 1998 movie Shakespeare in Love.She has since received Academy nominations for roles in Chocolat, Iris, Mrs Henderson Presents, Notes on a Scandal and, this year, for Philomena.She is currently in India filming The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2, but her best-known role continues to be James Bond's boss.But, after playing a pivotal role alongside Daniel Craig in Skyfall in 2012, the actress left the part behind, bequeathing it to Ralph Fiennes."My role as M is over," she told The Hollywood Reporter, "but having had 17 years I think, probably, I would have been given the sack by MI6 already. So it's someone else's turn."On a lighter note, the star also revealed that she had, on more than one occasion, brought her pet goldfish back to life."I've given the breath of life to [him] twice," she said."He's now about 8 inches long - almost a full shark - and yes, twice, I breathed into his mouth. He's now called Lazarus."^Dame Judi Dench says she has no plans to retire from acting, despite failing eyesight which has left her unable to read scripts.
It will house the town's library, a cafe, community space, and Anglesey's local history collection.Built in 1855, it was home to assembly rooms and a court.Last month, the Welsh Government successfully applied for a compulsory purchase order on the former owner of the market hall and the work is being funded by a Â£2.3m lottery grant.^Holyhead's Grade II-listed market hall is to be restored after standing derelict for 10 years.
With a fifth successive title win all but wrapped up, the PFA Scotland Player of the Year says thoughts are now turning to defending the crown next season."We're fired up again for next year," Griffiths said."We've got five in-a-row and next year we'll look at making it six."Griffiths scooped the Player of the Year prize after a season in which he has contributed 39 goals, and is humbled to be marked out by his peers as the top player in the country in this campaign."As a professional footballer to be voted as the player of the year is the main one, you are playing against teams week in week out and for them to vote you the best player in the country is special," said the Celtic striker."I still have {my young player award} in the house. My mum's wanting this one, but she's not getting it."Griffiths' individual displays have kept Celtic's title defence on-track this season, but failure in the cup competitions and in Europe has left many fans disillusioned with the club, and questioning the direction it is heading.Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early-season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support.Then came a League Cup semi-final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling he had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign."We were disappointing," admits Griffiths."The European campaign wasn't great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said it was a disaster but you know we played one of our worst games of the season and we drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery.""{Players} could've been performing better, you know we've lost silly points in silly games. We were beaten twice by Aberdeen, we've drawn a couple of home games we didn't score in but we still managed to wrap up a league title and that's the most important thing."The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced he would be exiting Parkhead in the summer.Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic."Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate," said the Scotland international."There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad."I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan."The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season.So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland."As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world.  But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us."Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year."Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend."The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday."We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us."Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team.The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order.Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September."I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn."We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man."^Leigh Griffiths says Celtic are "fired up" for next season as they aim to win a sixth straight Premiership title.
French President Francois Hollande expressed "deep sadness" at the death of Huguette Dupeu in a statement.Most of the dead in the raid were foreign tourists. Two of the attackers were killed by security forces.A huge march against terrorism is planned for Sunday that will finish outside the Bardo museum.President Hollande is among those expected at the event in the capital Tunis.Lyse Doucet: Tunisia's test of transitionCradle of 'Arab Spring' under threatThe museum's planned reopening earlier this week was postponed over security concerns.Schoolchildren and students were allowed in on Friday, with the general public to be readmitted Monday.The attack, claimed by Islamic State (IS), was the deadliest in Tunisia since the uprising which led to the overthrow of long-serving ruler  Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.Over 20 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, although just two gunmen are thought to have carried out the raid.They are said to have been trained in Libya in an area controlled by IS.The Tunisian Prime Minister, Habib Essid, has admitted "shortcomings" in the country's security system and has dismissed six police chiefs over the attack.^A Frenchwoman injured in the attack on Tunisia's national museum has died of her wounds, bringing the total killed in the assault by Islamists to 22.
Ten passengers on board the bus were reported to have been killed while all four crew members survived.Local TV showed the heavily damaged Boeing 727 Allied Air plane lying across a road close to Kotoka International Airport.Ghana's airport operator said the plane, which had flown from Lagos, Nigeria, overshot the runway.It said in a statement that the four crew members were receiving treatment at an airport clinic."The aircraft collided with a minivan, resulting in 10 confirmed fatalities," the statement added.Police and troops cordoned off the scene following the incident just after 19:00 GMT on Saturday.Ghana's Vice President John Dramani Mahama told reporters at the airport that a thorough investigation would be carried out."No early conclusions should be drawn. We should allow investigations to arrive at the actual cause. But I can assure Ghanaians that the situation is under control," he said.Ghana Airport Company said flights were continuing as normal at the airport.Kofi Kportufe, head of Ghana's national disaster management agency, praised the emergency services for their quick response, which he said had "averted further disaster"."This is a sad day for Ghana," he said.The BBC's West Africa correspondent John James says Ghana's air safety record has been good in recent years.^A cargo plane has crash landed in Ghana's capital Accra, hitting a bus full of passengers, officials say.
The trustees of Wykeham House School in Fareham had warned last month its future was in doubt.A statement blamed falling numbers and said most children had found alternative schools.The school offered single sex teaching for both boys and girls, charging fees of up to Â£4,100 per term. Both the boys' and girls' sites are to close.Wykeham House School was established, initially as a girls' school, in 1913 and has about 120 pupils.A new boys' senior school site opened in September 2014.Its website said the school prided itself on its "small classes and nurturing environment".Chair of trustees John Charles, said: 'We are sorry to be closing the doors on such a wonderful school."We have worked hard to explore different options to secure a future for our school but in the face of reducing pupil numbers and a shrinking market place for single sex education we have had to take the sad decision to close the school.'The school statement said it would close at the end of the autumn term.^An independent school in Hampshire has confirmed it will close because of "financial pressure".
Rolo, a  chocolate Labrador, was saved after two coastguard rescue teams and an RNLI lifeboat were called in, near Brixham.She was hauled up in a "dog rescue bag" on a line and reunited, uninjured, with her "very happy owners," the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said.The agency has urged owners to keeps their dogs on leads when they are walking near cliffs.More on Rolo, the rescued Labrador, and other Devon news^A dog was rescued after falling "up to 60ft (18m)" down a cliff in Devon.
Tigers are fifth after a season of struggle which has seen them sack director of rugby Richard Cockerill.They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season."There's a lot more to come from this team," Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport."Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season."I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically."Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third.They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final.Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition.The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop."A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script'," he said."We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time."We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point."We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints."We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game."The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other."One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case."^Leicester Tigers assistant coach Geordan Murphy says victory in Sunday's Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Exeter would be a big boost for their Premiership play-off aspirations.
Apart from good chefs, many restaurateurs will tell you that an excellent menu boasting many scrumptious dishes is a must.That seems like a good formula but not everyone would agree.Some Indian restaurants have relied on one signature dish to become legendary among food lovers.The BBC's Vikas Pandey profiles five such restaurants across the country.Giri Manjas has established itself as an institution in the southern coastal city of Mangalore. It's a small eatery and people have to often wait patiently for their turn to eat its signature fish fry.Seating only 25 people at a time, Giri Manjas serves around 200-300 portions of fried fish to its customers every day from 11am to 9pm.The restaurant's owner, Nandini M Pai, says the secret of the popularity of her famous dish is "freshness and love"."We always use fresh fish and spices and we still have the same cooks who started this journey with us 40 years ago. And we serve the dish with a lot of love," she says.Ms Pai adds that she has no ambition of opening more branches of her famous restaurant because "it's a tiny place for Mangaloreans and we are happy with that".To find Alamgir restaurant, you literally have to embark on a treasure hunt along the tiny winding bylanes of old Lucknow city in northern India.But the hard - and often confusing - work is worth it just for the mouth-watering taste of bund gosht, which literally translates from the Hindi as "closed meat".The owner of Alamgir Mujeeb Ahmed, 30, claims his father Rasheed Ahmed invented the famous dish in 1963.He explains that the dish is named bund gosht because "the meat, spices and herbs are mixed and then cooked in a sealed pot for hours on a low flame".However Mr Ahmed is not as forthcoming about the actual recipe, saying it is a "closely-guarded" secret."The recipe stays in the family. I learnt how to cook it from my father when I was 10 years old," he says.This is the 16th article in a BBC series India on a plate, on the diversity and vibrancy of Indian food.

And the coconut-based chutney that accompanies the dosa also has a unique taste.But when asked what goes into making it, the proprietor M Rajashekar says "let it be a secret".The recipe was invented by his father N Mylareshwara Swamy."Our recipe hasn't changed. My mother is 74 but she still keeps a very close eye on the ingredients to ensure that our taste remains the same," he says.The samosa, a savoury pastry often filled with potato, spices and onions, is one of the most popular street snacks and is sold in tiny shops across the country.But in the 1920s, Hari Ram gave the snack a radical twist, inventing what is now known as the "Hariram samosa".He used finely-ground spices as the filling and added some herbs to the pastry. The result was a mouth-watering dish which made the shop an instant hit in the entire region.More than 90 years later, his son, Sri Ram, continues his legacy."Our samosas are different because you can keep them for a month, unlike normal samosas, which you have to eat on the same day," he says.But again, he refuses to reveal the recipe."Forget the recipe and just enjoy the samosa. I will ensure that my family continues to run this shop even after I am gone and that too without changing the recipe," he says.Babu Bawarchi is a landmark for food lovers in Delhi. The humble shop has been selling its unique biryani, a one-dish meal made of rice, aromatic spices and meat, since 1967.The shop's main chef and owner, Moinudeen, says he is the fourth-generation chef of his family."My father invented the recipe of our biryani and I learnt it when I was 12-years-old, but only after four years of hard work," he says."Our recipe is complex and involves several stages of cooking. I don't mind sharing it with you, but you will need at least five years to master it under the watchful eyes of a senior chef," he explains.He adds that he wants to keep the shop small and humble to ensure that "everybody, rich or poor gets to taste the biryani"."If you haven't eaten biryani, you haven't lived," he says.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring's Aditi Mallya^What do you need to run a successful restaurant?
Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between £150 and £1,200 towards the cost of their case.MPs on the justice select committee said the charge, which is not means-tested, created "serious problems" and was often "grossly disproportionate".Ministers said it was under review.The fee is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty.It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases.In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals "pay their way".But chairman of the cross-party committee Bob Neill said: "The evidence we have received has prompted grave misgivings about the operation of the charge, and whether, as currently framed, it is compatible with the principles of justice."He added that "in many cases it is grossly disproportionate" and created "perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs".The committee's report said the lack of discretion for judges and magistrates on the level of the charge was creating "unacceptable consequences within the criminal justice system".It cited the case of a woman who had admitted stealing a four-pack of Mars Bars worth 75p, saying she "had not eaten in days" after her benefits were sanctioned.She was ordered to pay a £150 criminal courts charge on top of her £73 fine, £85 costs, a £20 victim surcharge and 75p compensation.The committee also said it was "highly sceptical" of government claims that the charges could deliver a net revenue of £80m to £160m a year by 2023 - with an annual cost of collection of about £20m and a £5m bill for imprisoning defaulters.The Ministry of Justice said the concerns were noted and the operation of the fee was being kept under review.It comes after Justice Secretary Michael Gove told Parliament earlier this month that the charge was generating revenue and helping to "ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate".But Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the criminal courts charge was "unrealistic and unjust" and called on the Ministry of Justice to "suspend this policy immediately"."The innocent have been put under pressure to plead guilty, and ordering indigent people to pay money they simply do not have is never going to work," she said.^The criminal courts charge should be scrapped by ministers, a parliamentary committee has said, as it raised "grave misgivings" about the fee's benefits.
Walker, who has 27 caps and spent eight seasons at Spurs has signed a five-year deal with City.The deal, which comes to £50m including £5m of add-ons, could make him the most expensive English player ever."I am thrilled to be signing for City and can't wait to get started," said Walker. "Pep Guardiola is one of the most respected managers in the world."Walker, who joined Spurs from Sheffield United in 2009 and made 183 Premier League appearances, added: "I feel he can help me take my game to a new level."The 27-year-old, who will wear the number two shirt, is expected to travel with City on Monday for their tour of the USA.City boss Guardiola released three full-backs at the end of last season, including both right-sided players - Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna.He missed out on the signing of free agent Dani Alves, with the Brazilian joining Paris St-Germain on Wednesday.Walker, selected in the 2016-17 Premier League team of the year, is City's third signing of the summer, after the arrivals of midfielder Bernardo Silva and goalkeeper Ederson Moraes.Walker made 31 league starts under Mauricio Pochettino last season as Tottenham recorded their highest top-flight finish since the 1962-63 season.The right-back recorded five assists for the Premier League runners-up, the joint-most for a defender in the division alongside Bournemouth's Adam Smith and Spurs team-mate Kieran Trippier, who made six of his 12 appearances from the bench.Walker also ranked highly among chances created by defenders and his 75 dribbles attempted was only less than Cherries full-back Smith (87) and Watford's Jose Holebas (88).Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker on Twitter:Kyle Walker becomes the world's most expensive defender at £50m plus.

Mutations of the NR5A1 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men, reports the American Journal of Human Genetics.Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London said it could help doctors investigating men with the condition.A UK expert said he hoped that further gene defects could be found.In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving.Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found.The latest research looks at a gene already known to be involved in sexual development in both men and women - defects in NR5A1 have been linked to physical defects in the development of the testicles or ovaries.Their findings suggest that, even where there is no physical evidence of a problem, defects in the gene may be hampering the ability to make sperm.They looked at the gene in 315 apparently healthy men who had an unexplained inability to produce sperm.From this group, they found mutations in the gene in just seven, and closer examination revealed the men had altered levels of sex hormones and, in one case, mild abnormalities in the cellular structure of the testicles.The research authors, from the UCL Institute of Child Health in London and the Institut Pasteur in Paris, said: "We conclude that approximately 4% of men with otherwise unexplained failure to produce sperm carry mutations in the NR5A1 gene."Although the find would affect only a small proportion of infertile men, other specialists believe that other similar discoveries could help build up a clearer picture of the origins of the condition.Dr Allan Pacey, a senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said that there was still "embarrassingly little" known about the genetics behind male infertility."Given the complexity of the sperm production process it is likely that many genes are involved and therefore that may gene defects linked to infertility may be found."Although this gene defect affects only a small number of men, we need more studies like this so that we can fill in the gaps in our knowledge and possibly one day build a robust diagnostic test for male fertility based on genetics."^A faulty gene could help explain some cases of unexplained male infertility, according to research.
It's part of the show's 30th anniversary week, so two good reasons for a party.Here are some tips on how to throw the perfect bash...It may be a poor substitute for Albert Square, but choose a character to dress up as and pop down the local market to pick your outfit.Will it be Whitney, will it be Max, will it be Ian?Whoever you pick, gold hoop earnings, plastic leather jackets, fake fur and tracksuits could be on the shopping list.You won't go far wrong with a chef's apron either.Fill your basket with cheap crisps, sweets and drinks.You may not be on first name terms with the cashier, or get into a row while you're in there, but if you try really hard you may just believe you're in the Minute Mart.For the main course, it's just got to be fish and chips.In honour of the Beale family, make it plaice.Make your guests really feel like they're stepping into Albert Square.A street sign on the front door, framed pictures of the cast around the room and the EastEnders theme tune on a loop would certainly help set the mood.If you really want to push the boat out, why not create your own Queen Vic, complete with a bar, a royal sculpture and a licence above the door?No Who Killed Lucy Beale party would be complete without some sort of competition to guess who the culprit actually is.Whoever gets the killer right, gets the prize. Yay!Sure, this may just be a bit of fun but at the heart of all this is the loss of a young woman's life (sort of).Yes, she had a history of causing trouble and getting up people's noses, but do take a minute to remember Lucy Beale.RIP Lucy, never forgotten.We are in no way condoning physical violence, but come on, no EastEnders event would be complete without a bit of a verbal bust up.After the big reveal, just let all that vent up frustration out of your system.Frowning all night and generally being a bit glum could also help you get in the mood.Have fun!In true EastEnders style, after the party, head to a trendy club around the corner.Ideally, you'll know practically everyone in there and the music will be so quiet you'll hear what the bloke at the end of the bar is saying.You'll probably get into a row with whoever's serving the drinks as well.Now you're really getting into the spirit of it.If you're nursing a sore head the next morning after all that "loud music", get down to your local greasy spoon for a fry up.And hopefully it will stop you feeling like this...Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube^Viewers have been guessing who did it for the last year, but on Thursday EastEnders will FINALLY reveal who killed Lucy Beale.
The 32-year-old right-back has been with Arsenal since the age of eight and has won nine league titles during her time at the club.Coach Pedro Martinez Losa said: "We are very pleased that Alex has signed a new contract with us.

Daly spent two seasons at Ibrox after leaving Tannadice, where he has been training since pre-season."I would never say never," the 32-year-old said of the possibility of signing for the Scottish Premiership club."If they came to me and were interested, I would definitely consider it."Daly spent six years at Tannadice and ended as club captain."I am currently training at Dundee United," he told BBC Scotland."When pre-season came about and I still hadn't got a club, I rang manager Jackie McNamara and asked if I could go in."They are a good club with some fantastic young players."I would never say never, but United would need to want me first."The United States appears to be a possible destination for Daly."I am probably looking further afield than Scotland," he said. "I'm looking abroad."At the moment, there are a few clubs interested, but they have their full forum of allocated players so they need to maybe lose one or two of them before they can move."It is looking like January before the foreign market can come about, so I might need to get something short term until then."Daly had no regrets about his move to Rangers, who helped the Ibrox side win Scotland's third tier before dropping to the bench for much of last season in the Championship."I was out of contract with Dundee United and at the time they were only prepared to offer a one-year contract," he said."When I spoke to Ally McCoist, they were prepared to offer two years."A lot of people say you are dropping down the divisions, which is a fair point, but it is going to a club of Rangers' stature, history, fan base, playing at Ibrox every second week and training at Murray Park every day."I was just delighted to go to a club like that and play for a man that I really respected in Ally McCoist."^Jon Daly has not ruled out a return to Dundee United, but the striker thinks his future probably lies abroad following his release by Rangers.
The listed properties on London Road were last used by the Witan International College 10 years ago.The university, which owns the buildings, and a private developer plan to convert them into 53 apartments.Christopher Reeve of the university said the buildings "create a sense of heritage" in the town.If planning permission is granted by Reading Borough Council, restoration work will start in early 2016 and is expected to take approximately nine months.^Three early 19th Century buildings in Reading are to be converted into private homes, under plans published by the University of Reading.
The poster features an officer and a message to parents asking them not to use the threat of the police when disciplining their children.Durham Constabulary wants children to see officers as people who can help rather than simply law enforcers.And the force's poster has been shared more than 47,000 times and liked by almost 35,000 people on Facebook.A force spokesman said: "Children should be taught from an early age that if they feel like are in danger and they need help, they can approach an officer who will reassure them."However, the poster has divided opinion on Facebook.Jeff Rowse said: "Telling them they will go to jail if they are bad is wrong how? Surely that is the major reason for having a police force? And jails?"In response Paul Parry said: "Telling a three-year-old that if he doesn't eat his dinner the policeman will come and take him to jail isn't true and will only serve to instil fear into that child."The police shouldn't be used to reinforce bad parenting."Others were more taken with the officer, with several people asking for him to be moved to their local force or saying they would happily go to him for help.^A poster urging parents not to use the police to scare their children has been seen more than 3.5 million times.
The patrols at Camber Sands in East Sussex will be funded with Â£51,000 allocated by Rother District Council as part of its annual budget.Councillor Sally-Ann Hart said the council needed to act after the "significant and unprecedented" deaths.Families of the men who drowned said a lifeguard service could have saved their lives.Five men died during a day-trip to the beach last August.  A month earlier, two others also lost their lives.The council said the beach attracted more than one million people each year.It said lifeguards would be present from the late May bank holiday until the end of the summer holidays "to offer reassurance" to visitors.Speaking after a council meeting on Monday night, Mrs Hart, the cabinet member for tourism, said: "Our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives."The incidents were significant and unprecedented and we need to react to the changing circumstances."We not only need to protect the visiting public, but also the economy and livelihoods of our coastal tourism businesses."However, she stressed the importance of "people from all communities across Britain being better informed" on beach and water safety before they visit.She said: "[The beach] can never be completely risk-free but we are committed to investing in our beach patrol, the lifeguard service and working with other agencies to ensure visitors to the beach are aware of the dangers of the sea."Full inquests into the deaths are awaited. The council said it would act on any recommendations the coroner might make.Five men from south-east London died on 24 August:Two others lost their lives in July:^Lifeguards will patrol a popular beach on the South Coast this summer after seven men drowned last year.
It is likely to include a scrappage scheme for older diesel cars in areas with high levels of dirty air.Speed bumps could be removed in some cities to cut pollution from cars slowing down and speeding up.Environmental lawyers ClientEarth said they would "thoroughly analyse" the proposals.According to the Royal College of Physicians, air pollution across the UK is linked to around 40,000 premature deaths every year.The UK has struggled to keep within EU limits on some pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is produced by diesel engines and is linked to a range of respiratory diseases including asthma. Some 37 of the 43 regions of the UK are in breach of NO2 limits.Under earlier government plans, some parts of the UK would not have met EU NO2 standards until 2030. The original deadline to achieve these limits was 2010.Exasperated by what they believed was government foot-dragging on the question of cleaner air, ClientEarth mounted a legal challenge to force faster action.In April 2015, the UK Supreme Court ruled the government had to take immediate steps on the issue.Unhappy with the timescales in the plan that was then produced, ClientEarth went to the High Court last November for a judicial review.Once again the court supported the lawyers, telling the government that its scheme was "woefully inadequate" and giving ministers until 24 April this year to produce a new draft.With a general election in the offing, the government last week asked the judge for permission to delay the draft plan. But Mr Justice Garnham disagreed and ordered publication by 9 May."These steps are necessary in order to safeguard public health," he said.Earlier this week, the government said it would not appeal against the ruling and would publish.In their previous plans, ministers wanted to create "clean air zones" in five cities outside London with high levels of NO2.Only the most polluting vehicles would have to pay a charge to enter the zone under that scheme. The new draft plan is expected to create many more such zones.Councils will be given the power to impose fines or restrictions on all polluting vehicles in these areas.In the worst cities, so called "toxin taxes" could range up to Â£20 a day but the government is said to be keen not to punish drivers who bought diesels as a result of incentives brought in by a previous Labour administration. This is something that the lawyers at ClientEarth support."Successive governments have encouraged people to buy diesel. We don't want to see diesel drivers vilified, and we think the plans should also include properly funded incentives to help people move to cleaner forms of transport," said ClientEarth CEO James Thornton."We will thoroughly analyse the government's draft plans when they are produced. If we do not think they are in line with the court order, to deal with illegal levels of pollution as soon as possible, then we will consider our next steps."According to newspaper reports, the government has agreed to back a "targeted" scrappage scheme for older diesel cars, but limited to vehicles in areas of high pollution. There may also be funding for a retrofitting scheme to help existing diesel car and van owners cut their emissions of NO2.The government is also said to be pushing for councils to use alternatives to charging, including the removal of speed bumps in some places and the better sequencing of traffic lights in others. Both of these measures could limit cars having to slow down and speed up repeatedly, actions that can almost double the amount of NO2 produced.However, the idea that speed bumps which slow down traffic would be sacrificed to help clean up the air we breathe is not a welcome concept according to road safety charity Brake."We ought not to be made to choose between having cleaner air and safer roads," a spokesman said."The evidence shows that air pollution is contributing to the early deaths of thousands of people. It's now clear that there's more than one way a car can kill you."The new proposals will be out for consultation for six weeks before the government produces a final plan at the end of July.Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook.^The UK government is set to publish a draft air pollution plan after a protracted legal battle with environmental campaigners.
It was due to be held at Queen's University in Belfast in June.In an email to delegates, the university's vice chancellor Patrick Johnston said he had made the decision on Monday that the event would not proceed.He cited concerns about the security risk for delegates and about the reputation of the university.The symposium: Understanding Charlie: New perspectives on contemporary citizenship after Charlie Hebdo, was due to be hosted by QUB's Institute for Collaborative Research in the Humanities.Twelve people died when two brothers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, fired on the journalists on 7 January at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris.Five others were killed over the two following days by one of their associates.^A conference in Belfast to discuss the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo murders has been cancelled.
Walter Palmer from the state of Minnesota is believed to have paid about ??32,000 to hunt lions in the wild.Cecil, the lion he shot, was a massive tourist attraction and famous in Africa for being relaxed around humans.Mr Palmer said he thought the hunt was legal and didn't know the lion was protected.Cecil's death has prompted a huge reaction from many on social media, with tens of thousands of people signing a petition asking for Cecil's killer to be punished for what he did.Hunting lions is not illegal in Zimbabwe, and in many other countries in Africa, but hunters have to have special permits from the government allowing them to kill certain animals.Some people in Zimbabwe also argue hunting can have a positive impact.They say the money paid by tourists can be used for conservation and to create jobs for local people.I don't think people should hunt animals for sport, it's wrong and what did Cecil do to Walter in the first place? Nothing! It's not fair, money can't buy what that lion gave to us, love. If Walter can't see that he should open his eyes and see what really is important in life - money or love?Daisy, Monmouthshire, WalesI believe that it is a cruel sport that shouldn't be done anywhere because the killing of animals will increase extinction. Even though the killing of animals is still done in certain countries I believe it is a cruel and unforgiving sport. From what has happened I believe that if anyone spends money to slay an animal they should still be arrested. In my opinion if anyone would want to pay to kill an animal I would consider them 'sick in the head'.Ellie, Leeds, EnglandI think it's wrong to hunt animals for sport because the hunter doesn't benefit from it and it's strange that someone gets a buzz from taking an animal's life. I know people that hunt deer but they do it for food and appreciate the fact that they've had to kill an animal to get the meat.Jake, Essex, EnglandIt's not right to kill animals or hunt them for sport as they have a conscience and mind. They didn't do anything to harm you, so why should you harm them?Jonnie, Buckinghamshire, EnglandSport is about feeling good about yourself but killing the eco-system is not a sport especially when a vital animal is killed.Honor, London, EnglandIt is certainly not right to hunt animals for sport. How would the hunters feel if a lion chased after them with a weapon (or, of course, without - those teeth can be deadly anyway)? They'd be scared, stressed, and worried.

The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP.It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada.It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law.One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments.There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them.This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements.Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries.Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn).In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.John Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  "will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands".The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.^A campaign group website says over a million people in the European Union have signed a petition against trade negotiations with the United States.
But after losing their opening home fixture, 40 overs of play were possible before the weather closed in.It was dominated by Tom Westley and Cook following the loss of Nick Browne.Their unbroken stand of 128 in 37 overs, with the stylish Westley making an unbeaten 70, fully justified Essex's decision to bat first, reaching 144-1.He was the more aggressive batsmen, reaching his half century off 64 balls to brighten a gloomy, drizzly day.It was the sixth successive first-class match in which he has passed 50, starting with his appearance for the MCC in Abu Dhabi against county champions Yorkshire in March.England Test captain Cook, who has already scored two centuries this season against Gloucestershire and Sussex, hit seven fours and a six off England team-mate Moeen Ali as he completed a more sedate fifty off 112 balls.Rain and bad light meant the loss of the entire afternoon session following a morning session in which Worcestershire's New Zealand international fast bowler Matt Henry went for 11 off his first over before quickly claiming the only wicket to fall when he had Browne caught behind.Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester:"It was a frustrating day to watch as a coach because I know anything we do isn't through lack of effort."But we didn't quite have our discipline with us this morning and probably over-pitched and were a little bit on the full side with deliveries at times."Credit to them in some ways in trying to get those wickets early but they just didn't quite get it right and it cost us momentum really."Essex head coach Chris Silverwood:"We were delighted to win the toss. We got off to a good start. It is essential if you want to capitalise when you have won the toss."We have got ourselves in a reasonable position. I won't count any chickens yet. There is still along way to go."But hopefully we can restart tomorrow morning and build on the start the guys at the top of the order have given us and see where that takes us."^England captain Alastair Cook continued his fine start to the season with an unbeaten 53 on another rain-hit day at New Road against Worcestershire.
The charity said tests confirmed all of the cats near Victor Avenue, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, had ingested the toxic substance.In the most recent case, seven-month-old Meereen died on Monday.An RSPCA spokesman said it was unclear whether the poisonings were accidental or deliberate.Updates on this story and more from LeicestershireThree other cats in the area have died in the last seven days, while another cat died two weeks ago.Meereen's "devastated" owner, Adria Pearce, said the cat came home on Friday evening and "seemed to be shivering a little"."I haven't been able to stop crying since she died," she said."We found her behind the sofa, where she was foaming from the mouth and trying to be sick."Meereen was taken to the vets - where it was confirmed she had consumed antifreeze - and died three days later.RSPCA inspector, Andy Bostock, is appealing for everyone in the area to ensure pesticides and chemicals were stored safely."We are very concerned," he said."It is the time of year where people use antifreeze in their cars, so if you do, please make sure there are no leaks and any spills are cleaned up properly."^Five cats have died from antifreeze poisoning on or near the same street in the space of two weeks, the RSPCA has said.
According to Radio-Canada, officials entered a hotel room where members of the travelling equestrian show Cavalia were staying on 14 July.The public broadcaster said officials made a number of arrests and two Canadians remain in prison.A spokesperson for Cavalia said they were trying to arrange for two employees to return to Canada."This is a private matter. All I can tell you is that recently, Chinese representatives have contacted us to ask if we were willing to buy airplane tickets to quickly repatriate them in Canada, and of course we are," spokesperson Eric Paquette told the BBC."At this point, our hope is that the repatriation process unfolds rapidly."Global Affairs Canada said it is providing consular services to two citizens who were detained in Beijing."Consular services are being provided to two Canadians who were detained in Beijing, China, as well as to their families," said a spokesperson for the department."Consular officials are in contact with local authorities to gather additional information."Due to privacy considerations, we are unable to provide further information on this matter."Cavalia was created in 2003 by one of the co-founders of Cirque de Soleil, and has been described as "equestrian ballet". It has been performing in Beijing since April and even planned to build a permanent theatre in Hangzhou.China's drug laws are very strict, and trafficking large amounts of drugs can lead to a death sentence.Even minor drug crimes can lead to an arrest or deportation.In 2014, China banned several celebrities caught using drugs from performing on state media.^Chinese authorities have arrested two Canadians in the capital Beijing for allegedly smoking marijuana.
Carwyn Jones told The Guardian newspaper that people's "sense of disengagement with Brussels" could attach itself to London after Brexit.The UK government said it will trigger the Article 50 process on March 29.Mrs May, visiting Swansea, promised to seek the "best possible deal" that would work for everyone across the UK.Mr Jones told The Guardian the prime minister had a "tin ear" on matters of devolution.He warned the future of the UK could be under threat if the UK government did not listen to the other administrations."If they are not careful, people's sense of disengagement with Brussels will simply attach itself to London," he said."They are giving the impression sometimes that they do not listen."And what kind of message is that to the people of Wales?"Amid calls in Scotland for a second referendum on independence, the first minister said Wales needed to see a "dividend" for his government's continued support of a United Kingdom."Otherwise people in Wales are going to start saying, well, the government is listening to the Scots, we need to be like them," he said."And that's a dangerous path for the UK."Last week, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to seek approval for a second independence referendum, to be held between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019.Mr Jones met Mrs May in her visit to Swansea on Monday, during which she also signed the Â£1.3bn Swansea Bay Region city deal.Following the meeting, the first minister said the talks had been "constructive"."It was made clear that Welsh interventions had helped change and strengthen the UK positions on transition arrangements and on workers' rights," Mr Jones said.He called for more "partnership working" in the vein of the city deal as Article 50 approaches.Mrs May said she wanted to get "the best possible deal for the United Kingdom that works for everyone across the United Kingdom".She said the objectives included a "good free trade deal" and co-operation on matters such as security.Later in the afternoon, Mr Jones warned the assembly's constitutional and legislative affairs committee there could be Supreme Court challenges if the UK government took back powers from Europe and then decided which were to be devolved."I think that's wrong," he said. "That's not the way we read our devolution settlement. It is the way that many in the UK government see it."He also told the committee, meeting in Newport, that it was "not always clear" that the Wales Office had "much influence" within the UK government.^Welsh support for the UK could be in doubt if Theresa May does not listen to concerns about devolution, the first minister has warned.
Ospreys players Olly Cracknell, De Kock Steenkamp, Dan Baker, Dafydd Howells and Sam Parry joined collectors in Baglan Moors on Tuesday.The players said it was to show their commitment to the "Ospreylian community".Last week they took part in collections in Swansea and Bridgend.Cracknell said: "It was an early start but a great work-out for us this morning."A huge thanks to the recycling teams for showing us the ropes, they do a great job every day and we've enjoyed getting involved and giving a hand."^They are more familiar with recycling the ball than rubbish but five rugby players took a break from the pitch to collect refuse in Neath Port Talbot.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe Blues boss says his side have "almost" won the Premier League title after their 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge moved them 10 points clear at the top.United dominated possession and had more chances than the league leaders.Mourinho said: "We prepared for it to be like this. It was the game we wanted and expected."Chelsea will be champions if they win at Arsenal and Leicester in their next two matches, having beaten third-placed United with a first-half goal from Eden Hazard.Visiting manager Louis van Gaal said it was his side's "best display of the season" but Mourinho insists it was part of the game plan."It was difficult, but less than you think," he said. "Control their direct football to Marouane Fellaini and control the wingers from making crosses on the inside foot."When we know Wayne Rooney plays in midfield, we control his progression into the box. Control set-pieces and don't give away direct free-kicks as they have three specialists."Wait for a mistake and score a goal. We were able to make their important players disappear. Nobody saw them. They were in our pockets."United went into the match knowing they needed to win for the first time in five league visits to Chelsea to have any realistic hope of winning the title.But, despite big celebrations at the end of the match, Mourinho was careful to point out his side are not champions yet."We are not celebrating," he said. "Football is not about 'ifs' and 'almosts', it is about mathematics. When it is done, it is done, and until that moment we don't celebrate."The celebration is because we have beaten one of the biggest clubs in the world. The celebration is because they have everything to win that game and the result is because of the work they did all week to prepare for this game."I feel we are almost there but there are no 'almosts' in football."^Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said Manchester United's important players were "in our pockets" in a match that went "exactly" as they wanted.
Police said the man was being held over alleged offensive behaviour. He is understood to be among those pictured in a recent police CCTV images appeal.Several appeals for information were made after toilets were vandalised at the game and offensive effigies of Rangers fans were hung from the stands.The match, which Celtic won 5-1, took place at Celtic Park on 10 September.^A 23-year-old man has been arrested in connection with disorder at the recent Celtic v Rangers game in Glasgow.
The sculpture, depicting a sprawled murder victim surrounded by police tape, was crowned winner of the Cornwall Beach Games sandcastle competition.But Devon and Cornwall Police was criticised after boasting officers tweeted about their victory.Labour councillor Hannah Toms said some would find it "very offensive".The force said it was a "fun event" and officers had not intended to cause any offence.Ms Toms acknowledged officers had intended to be "light-hearted" but said the sandcastle "somewhat misses the mark and is in a bit of poor taste"."I like a joke as much as the next person but this is a family beach event," she said."As a parent I would not be very happy to explain to my child what it was all about."It's trivialising quite a serious matter."Ms Toms added: "I think there's a level of sexual stereotyping with the large bottom and the large breasts. Police have been working really hard to break down barriers on reporting sex crimes and I don't think this image really helps their cause."Reaction on social media was mixed, with some defending the sandcastle.Hazel Jago said on Facebook: "So it's a team of police officers representing the type of work they deal with. What's the problem!? There is always someone that will whinge about something."Lorraine Lardon said: "People need an injection of humour."A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: "If any offence has been cause by the nature of the sculpture, this was never intended and we apologise for that."^A police force has apologised after its officers made a sandcastle "crime scene" featuring a naked dead woman.
It is being performed at Curve theatre in Leicester, the city where Townsend lived and where the book is set.The writer worked on the musical before her death last April and her family have given their blessing to the production going ahead.There will be more than 30 performances over the next four weeks.The author's family were at Curve for the opening night.Her husband, Colin Broadway, said his wife had been "thrilled" to be working on the musical during 2012-14.The role of Adrian is being shared by Lewis Andrews, Sebastian Croft, Joel Fossard-Jones and Toby Murray.The roles of Pandora, Nigel and Barry are each being shared by three actors.This has meant everything has needed rehearsing four times.Executive producer Chris Stafford said: "For us this is something that is the culmination of three and a half years' worth of work, but also we really hope it to be a fitting tribute to Sue, that will really introduce Adrian Mole hopefully to a new generation of audiences."^A musical version of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13ยพ has opened as a tribute to the book's author Sue Townsend.
The boy, named locally as Reggie, was attacked at a house in Falkland Road at about 04:15 BST.He was taken to hospital where he later died. Police said the small terrier dog had been removed from the address and was likely to be destroyed.Northumbria Police said a 30-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the incident.A family member, who did not want be identified, said the baby's mother - named locally as Maria Blacklin - was not in the house when the youngster was attacked.The man said the baby's mother never left her son alone with the dog and she was devastated by what had happened.A neighbour said the baby was a "lovely bairn".She said: "They're all right [the family], they're no bother and his wife, she looks after them bairns, she was over the moon with her little boy."It's a shock more than anything else, I cannot get over it. It's shocking."Flowers have been laid against the front wall of the house, along with cards bearing messages of support.Superintendent Gillian Mitchell said: "As you can appreciate, we have concerns with regards to the care of the child at the time this incident occurred."They [the family] are absolutely devastated as you would imagine, it's tragic to lose a child at any stage, but in these circumstances it is just unbelievable."They are receiving support... it is a very difficult time, the officers attending the scene this morning were faced with quite a significant incident to deal with."It's a tragic isolated incident and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the baby and indeed our officers who have dealt with this incident."Police said additional officers were in the area to provide reassurance to support the public during an "horrendous time in the community".A police car remains parked directly outside the front of the property.Police said the family's dog posed no threat to the wider public and is now in secure kennels.More than 200,000 people a year are estimated to be bitten by dogs in England, according to research for the British Medical Journal.Since 2005, 22 people have been killed by dogs in the UK, 12 of them children, according to the Office for National Statistics.Everybody you speak to in this quiet tree-lined street knows the family of little Reggie.His proud mum had introduced him to their neighbours in recent days.They also knew the family had a dog, a small terrier which they believed had a good temperament. It obviously didn't.Those same neighbours have spent the afternoon leaving flowers outside the three week old baby's home - many of them in tears."He was a bonny little lad", one of them remarked.A relative came by to tell us the terrier dog was usually kept in a brick outhouse at night. He couldn't understand why the dog was in the house. He also told us the dog was always well behaved around the other children in the home.The animal is now being kept in secure kennels while police continue their investigation. Meanwhile, a family is trying to come to terms with the loss of their new born child in such horrific circumstances.^A three-week-old baby boy has died after being bitten by a dog in Sunderland.
Forensic expert Susan Williamson was giving evidence at the trial of William Burns and Alexander Porter, who deny attacking Russell Findlay.The High Court in Glasgow heard she examined a jacket, mail bag, a knife and a jar that had contained acid.The jury was told DNA matching Mr Burns was found on the jacket.Prosecutor Richard Goddard asked Miss Williamson: "When you examined the jacket you obtained a DNA profile which matched William Burns," and she replied: "Yes."Ms Williamson told the court that she also examined the handle of the knife found at the scene and said the major DNA contributor was Mr Porter.The court was told the odds on the DNA belonging to anyone else not related to the men was a billion to one.Defence counsel Susan Duff, representing Mr Porter, said: "There are a number of ways DNA could have got there," and Ms Williamson said: "Yes."As well as working for the Sun newspaper, Mr Findlay is the author of books about Glasgow crime gangs.Mr Findlay has already given evidence alleging that a man claiming to be a postman came to his door at 08:30 on 23 December 2015.The journalist said the man, whom he identified as Burns, threw liquid onto the right side of his face and right eye.The jury has heard from an eye specialist that Mr Findlay's sight could have been saved by a neighbour dousing is face with water.Mr Burns, 56, and Mr Porter, 48, also deny attempting to murder Ross Sherlock by shooting at him repeatedly near St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs on 24 September 2015.The trial before Judge Sean Murphy QC continues.^DNA matching two men accused of throwing acid at the face of a Scottish Sun journalist was found on items at the scene, a court has heard.
And it's tucked away for a very good reason.Inside, your senses are greeted by the smell of rotting dog food, the buzz of blowflies and the purple UV light of the fly killer ready to zap escapees.This is where the museum's forensic entomologists breed different species of fly in a bid to help the police solve crimes.Museum scientist Amoret Whitaker is one of just three forensic entomologists in the UK who regularly works with the police to determine the time of death of a corpse."As soon as a person dies, their body starts to decompose and they give off specific odours. These different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects. And in the inital stages it's especially blowflies.""So when someone dies, fairly soon, it could be within minutes blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue.""You get a lot of male blowflies hanging around, sitting on plants around the body, waiting for suitable female mates."And it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone's death.By understanding the "succession" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died.But scientists only have developmental data on perhaps half of the twelve or so species of fly that are regulary found on dead bodies.By breeding them in "captivity" under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death.The accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours.But, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days.This timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder."In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes."The time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February.One pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been "mummified".The critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C.This peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks.The man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck.The police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise."We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks.""It's rare that our evidence is used in court. It's more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence."Forensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist.Between working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.There she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the "body farm".In the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers.Her research isn't finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays."The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards," she told BBC News.She also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used."This work will have a big impact when it's published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers."Amoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event "After Hours: Science Uncovered" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200^At the top of a long staircase in a room in a tower, far away from the throng of visitors and other scientists and laboratories is the Natural History Museum's insectory.
Northampton's North has a hamstring injury while Leinster's Henshaw has damaged a pectoral muscle.Both were injured during Tuesday's 31-31 draw with Hurricanes.Neither featured in the Lions' opening Test defeat and they will leave the tour party after Saturday's second Test in Wellington.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNorth, 25, starred with two tries in three Test appearances when the Lions beat Australia 2-1 in the 2013 series.Henshaw, 24, was on his first Lions tour, having played 29 times for Ireland.Lions coach Warren Gatland said: "It's unfortunate with Robbie doing the pectoral muscle, which puts him out so he's heading back to Ireland - I think he has an operation on Monday."And then George with the hamstring as well. It's unfortunate for him and his tour is over as well."However, Gatland says the Lions have been "lucky" overall.Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg was first to leave the tour after suffering a facial injury in their third tour game.He was followed by Wales back-rower Ross Moriarty, who succumbed to a back problem.The Lions lost the series opener 30-15 in Auckland, and go into the second Test in Wellington on Saturday with captain Sam Warburton coming in on the flank.Gatland has also brought in Johnny Sexton at fly-half with Owen Farrell moving to inside centre.^Wales wing George North and Ireland centre Robbie Henshaw have been ruled out of the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.
Theresa May said EU leaders' remarks showed it was "absolutely right" for the UK not to have acted unilaterally.EU Council president Donald Tusk has said there can be no "reciprocal" deal on expats until formal talks begin.He was responding to criticism from Tory politicians who accused EU figures of "standing in the way" of a deal.Replying to a question in the Commons from Conservative MP Peter Lilley, Mrs May said she hoped the issue would be examined early during the Brexit negotiations, which cannot begin until she has triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.The PM said it was "right" to give reassurance to both sets of citizens, adding: "But I think the reaction that we've seen shows why it was absolutely right for us not to do what the Labour Party wanted us to do, which was simply to give away the guarantee to rights of EU citizens here in the UK, because as we've seen that would've left UK citizens in Europe high and dry."The letter from 81 mostly Conservative MPs and peers called for a speedy resolution and pointed the finger at EU Brexit negotiators for holding up a deal.It said members of the European Commission appeared "worryingly indifferent" for British and EU citizens and called for discussions to "move forward quickly"."People are not bargaining chips," it said."Human being are not cards to be traded 'tit for tat' in a political playground."In response, Mr Tusk said their criticism had "nothing to do with reality".He said the vote for Brexit - not the stance taken by EU negotiators - had created "anxiety and uncertainty", saying the best way to "dispel the fears and doubts of all the citizens concerned" was to trigger Article 50, which begins a two-year negotiation process.The EU was ready to begin talks as soon as Article 50 was triggered, he said.There have been calls from some MPs for the government to offer a unilateral guarantee to EU nationals in the UK, but ministers have said this must form part of a deal with other member states for Britons living overseas.In the House of Lords, Home Office Minister Baroness Williams of Trafford quoted Mrs May's comment from PM's questions and said the "only circumstances" in which it would not be possible to protect the status of EU nationals in the UK would be if "British citizens' rights in the other EU member states were not protected in turn".The government's stance was criticised by Lib Dem Baroness Ludford, who said there was cross-party support for a unilateral commitment from the government.This would be the "morally right thing to do" she said, adding that the 27 other EU member states would then find it impossible not to match the UK's offer.^Britons living around Europe would have been left "high and dry" if the rights of EU citizens to stay in the UK had been guaranteed, the PM has said.
A San Francisco judge has placed January's executive order in limbo, but the White House is vowing to appeal.San Francisco and Santa Clara County sued in February.The Trump administration has warned so-called sanctuary cities they could lose federal funds if they do not co-operate with federal immigration officials.On Tuesday, Judge William Orrick issued a temporary injunction against the presidential order as the case continues in the courts."It's the 9th Circuit going bananas," White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, in reference to the San Francisco-based appeals court, which conservatives often accuse of liberalism.Mr Trump's measure cast doubt on the transfer of some $1.2bn (Â£940m) for San Francisco and $1.7bn to Santa Clara County, home to many Silicon Valley communities.It is another legal defeat for President Trump in his efforts to curb immigration - his plan to curtail travel from seven Muslim-majority nations was twice blocked in federal courts.Lawyers for the federal government had argued in the sanctuary cities case that only funding related to law enforcement would be withheld.But Judge Orrick said any doubt about the scope of the "vague" order was erased by public comments made by President Trump, such as those calling the measure a "weapon" to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies.He accused the Trump administration of a "schizophrenic approach" to the order.The 49-page court ruling added that the plaintiffs challenging President Trump's order are likely to succeed in proving the order unconstitutional."Federal funding... cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves," the judge wrote.However, Judge Orrick's ruling allowed the justice department to follow through with threats made to nine cities last week to cut specific programme grants if they do not adequately co-operate with federal immigration officers.In a press release last week, the department accused sanctuary cities of "crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime".There are several sanctuary cities across the US, including Mr Trump's home of New York.New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Tuesday's ruling, saying the president went beyond his authority to cut funding to cities that "don't share his illogical and unconstitutional desire to scapegoat immigrants".Trump starts a 'sanctuary city' war with liberal America^The White House has labelled "bananas" a ruling that blocks President Donald Trump's order barring funding for cities that shelter illegal immigrants.
Supported by 89 from Steven Mullaney, Root hit two sixes and 10 fours in his 93-ball first List A century, as Notts recovered from 92-4 to reach 303-6.Jonathan Trott hit 14 fours in his 104, his 21st limited-overs century.But the holders fell short on 293-9 to lose by 10 runs, a third straight loss.Warwickshire needed 49 from the last five overs as the pressure mounted, and after Rikki Clarke and Keith Barker both holed out, that became 16 needed off the last over, bowled by Luke Fletcher, but two run-outs sealed the hosts' fate.Bears captain Ian Bell made 51, but he was the second of three victims for Mullaney, who crucially accounted for Trott, no sooner than the former England batsman had reached three figures - for the fourth time in his last 10 One-Day Cup innings.After starting their defence of the trophy with an impressive 10-wicket win against Warwickshire, the Bears' third straight defeat now leaves them second bottom in North Group ahead of Sunday's visit of winless Lancashire.Notts climb to fourth in the group, three points behind leaders Worcestershire, ahead of Sunday's home fixture against Leicestershire at Welbeck Colliery.Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott told BBC WM:"We lost our way a little bit with the bat and lost too many wickets at crucial times, including myself. I shouldn't have got out when I did."If I had got a few more runs, 120 or 130, it would have been a lot easier for the rest of the guys coming in."Mullaney and Root batted well to get them up to a defendable total but the disappointing thing is that we had chances in the game to close it out and win it and unfortunately we couldn't do it."Nottinghamshire batsman Billy Root told BBC Radio Nottingham:"The century just snuck up on me really. I wasn't thinking about it. It was just a question of trying to score as many runs as possible."There were a lot of high-fives in the dressing-room which was nice. I haven't checked my messages yet but I am sure there will be one from Joe."It's nice to be selected for the start of a competition and then it's your job to try to contribute and I am happy to have done so. It's a great dressing-room to be in at the moment. Everyone is in such a good place."^Nottinghamshire's Billy Root, younger brother of England Test captain Joe, hit an unbeaten 107 at Edgbaston to help them beat Warwickshire and record a second successive One-Day Cup win.
Donald Skene grappled with worshippers and headbutted prayers posted on the walls of the Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road last December.Skene, 38, was ordered to complete 156 days of the unexpired portion of his jail term for breaching his licence.He was also sentenced to a year's supervision following his release.Dundee Sheriff Court was told Skene shouted: "I'm white but I'm one of you, brothers", to the Muslim congregation after being arrested.In CCTV footage shown to the court, Skene was seen entering the mosque's wash room and wandering around crying, as members of the congregation prepared to enter the prayer room.Depute fiscal Charmaine Gilmartin the court: "His behaviour is bizarre - attempts are made to try and calm him down."Skene is then seen running in circles around the prayer room as worshippers speak to him.Mrs Gilmartin said: "There are various religious texts in glass frames around the room."The accused punches some of them and latterly headbutts them."He had entered using Islamic greetings, and when he was arrested he refers to members of the congregation as brothers and shouts 'I'm white but I'm one of you'."Ross Donnelly, defending, said: "He is very apologetic."Skene admitted charges of breach of the peace and resisting arrest.Allegations that the offence was religiously aggravated were deleted by the Crown.The court was told Skene had already spent 10 weeks on remand for the offence.^A man who rampaged through a Dundee mosque while on licence for seriously assaulting his sister has been returned to prison.
More than 700,000 employees face unpaid leave due to the shutdown which was triggered after the two houses of Congress did not agree on a new budget.Hyundai said affected employees who currently own its vehicles will be given a payment relief "for as long as they are out of work".Employees looking to buy a new car will be given a 90-day payment deferral."We recognize the impact on family budgets that the furlough will drive," John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement.Hyundai had offered a similar scheme, the Hyundai Assurance programme, during the peak of the global financial crisis four years ago to help consumers who had lost their jobs.Many analysts have said that the move had helped the South Korean firm win customer loyalty and boosted its sales in recent years.The company said that its latest offer to help the federal employees was an addition to that programme and aimed at "helping workers at a time when they most need it"."Like we did almost four years ago when we launched Hyundai Assurance, this is our way of saying 'We've got your back' during this uncertain time," Mr Krafcik said.Under the latest offer, Hyundai will extend all auto loan and lease payments during the shutdown for current Hyundai owners who are put on unpaid leave.The programme is available to all customers who have financed their purchase or lease through Hyundai Finance America.^Hyundai Motor will defer payments due from US federal employees affected by the partial government shutdown.
Former Dons midfielder Sheerin, 39, has been player-manager at the Red Lichties since 2010 and replaces Neil Cooper at Pittodrie.Arbroath were relegated to Scottish League Two after finishing season 2013-14 bottom of League One.Aberdeen chief executive Duncan Fraser said boss Derek McInnes chose Sheerin after "a comprehensive process".Speaking on the club's website, Fraser added: "Despite wishing to retain Paul's services, Arbroath chairman John Christison was good to deal with and completely appreciated Paul's desire to come back to Aberdeen."Sheerin played for several Scottish clubs and also featured for Östersunds in Sweden before moving into coaching. He won a Scotland Under-21 cap in in the mid-1990s.Sheerin guided the Arbroath to their first national trophy in their history by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011.^Paul Sheerin has left his post as Arbroath manager to become Under-20s coach at Aberdeen.
The victims all worked at the plant 100km (62 miles) east of Porto.The factory's owner was among the dead and several members of his family were either dead or missing, said local mayor Francisco Lopes.Some of the victims were found outside the factory, apparently propelled from the building by the force of the blast.An initial explosion happened shortly after 17:30 (16:30 GMT) on Tuesday, followed by two more blasts, reports said.Five bodies were found late on Tuesday and emergency workers found a sixth victim some 200m (650ft) from the site, minister Jorge Gomes told Portuguese media. The search was being extended to a radius of 800m, he added, because of the scale of the explosion.The factory was described as a family business.As investigators tried to identify the victims, the mayor said that almost all of the eight caught up in the blast were members of Egas Sequeira's family. Mr Sequeira was among those feared dead along with one of his daughters and a son-in-law, Portuguese media said.The owner's wife had left the building just before the explosion and survived but two other family members were among the missing.Officials were initially unable to enter the site because of the potential risk to their safety. Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was due to visit the scene on Wednesday.^Six people died and another two were missing after an explosion on Tuesday evening destroyed a fireworks factory near the Portuguese town of Lamego.
Russia has sent a super-tanker aircraft capable of carrying tons of water to douse the fires.The series of fast-spreading fires, mostly in Chile's central region, are being fanned by strong winds, high temperatures and a prolonged drought.One town, Santa Olga, has been destroyed by the blaze.^More international help has been arriving in Chile to help the country fight the worst wildfire in its modern history.
The first and deputy first ministers used powers under what is known the Royal Prerogative to create the role for former BBC journalist David Gordon.Mr Gordon edited the BBC's Nolan Show.The Newsletter has discovered the law was changed using the highly unusual procedure to enable the post to be filled without being advertised.The Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt, who is the leader of the Opposition at the Northern Ireland Assembly, said he was not made aware of the move.Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), accused First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of "flagrantly breaching due process"."How many spin doctors does Stormont need? They already have 161," Mr Allister told the Newsletter."How ironic that the latest appointee is the very person who hitherto would have railed against and exposed the contrived process by which he was appointed."When contacted by the BBC, Mr Gordon said he could not comment on the issue.A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Executive Office said: "It is normal practice in politics in London and Dublin as well as other devolved governments for ministers to select the people who provide them specialist communications advice."Those trying to throw dirt know that very well."The appointment of the executive press secretary is in full accordance with the powers at the disposal of the first minister and deputy first minister and they make this Order under the powers conferred on them by section 23 (3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998."The office's spokesperson described the reaction from opposition politicians as "panic and hysteria".Mr Gordon is also a former Belfast Telegraph journalist and following his appointment on Tuesday, the first and deputy first ministers expressed delight.They said they wanted their new press secretary to provide them with expert advice and spearhead the communication of Stormont's policies.However, the method used to hire him has raised questions from serving and former public appointments commissioners.The current public appointments commissioner Judena Leslie has written to the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service over the appointment.In a statement on Friday, she said: "It is in the public interest that the principles of openness and transparency are adhered to."^Opposition politicians have expressed concern about the use of a special legal procedure to appoint a new Stormont press secretary.
Thermal cameras detected higher temperatures in three adjacent stones at the bottom of the Great Pyramid.Officials said possible causes included the existence of empty areas inside the pyramid, internal air currents, or the use of different building materials.It comes as experts search for hidden chambers within the pyramids.The tombs of the pharaohs Khufu (Kheops), Khafre (Khephren) and Menkaure (Mycerinus) were built in the Fourth Dynasty, about 2613-2494BC.A team of architects and scientists from Egypt, France, Canada and Japan used infrared thermography to survey the pyramids during sunrise, as the sun heats the limestone structures from the outside, as well as at sunset when they cool down.In a statement, the Egyptian antiquities ministry said the experts had "concluded the existence of several thermal anomalies that were observed on all monuments during the heating-up or the cooling-down phases"."To explain such anomalies, a lot of hypotheses and possibilities could be drawn up: presence of voids behind the surface, internal air currents," it added.An "particularly impressive" anomaly was found at ground level on the eastern side of the Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, the statement said."The first row of the pyramid's stones are all uniform, then we come here and find that there's a difference in the formation," Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati said as he showed reporters the three stones showing higher temperatures.Other thermal anomalies were detected in the upper half of the Great Pyramid.The structure will be the subject of further investigation during the Operation Scan Pyramids project, which began on 25 October and is expected to last until the end of 2016.^An international team of architects and scientists have observed "thermal anomalies" in the pyramids of Giza, Egyptian antiquities officials say.
Their remains were found in a single grave in Coghalstown, County Meath, in the Republic of Ireland in June.Mr McKee's sisters said they were glad that 43 years after his death they can bury him with their mother.The Disappeared are victims murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Northern Ireland conflict.Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright were both IRA members who were abducted and murdered by the organisation in 1972.Their bodies were found unexpectedly during a search for another of the Disappeared, Joe Lynskey.After the official identification, Mr McKee's sisters, Maria and Philomena, told the BBC: "It is bittersweet news that our brother's remains have been identified."The news has hit us with the shock of reality, even though we were expecting it."We are so so glad that, after 43 years, he will now be buried with our mother who never recovered from his disappearance."Over the past 16 years, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) has searched for 16 people who were officially listed as the Disappeared.The remains of 12 of the victims have been recovered and formally identified to date.In a joint statement, ICLVR commissioners, Sir Ken Bloomfield and Frank Murphy, said they had received the results from DNA samples."The results positively indicate that the remains are those of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee," the statement said."Dr Brian Farrell, coroner for the City of Dublin, has accepted this as evidence of identification and will shortly authorise the release of the remains to the families."Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams said the news would "bring an end to the uncertainty for the McKee and Wright families"."I want to appeal again for anyone with any information on those remains still not found to bring that information forward to the families, to the commission or myself," he said.^Confirmation that bodies found in a bog were Disappeared victims Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright is "bittersweet news", the McKee family has said.
A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for "atheism and espionage".During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation "God is Greatest" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith.The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society.TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening.Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far.Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios.In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark.In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead.In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants.The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests.This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas.Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to "torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them".And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank.Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case.Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor.In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake.The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared.Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was "unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame".Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden.The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month.Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue.But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals.The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat.It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations.As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: "Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective."BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Gary Price was suspended from all council duties for five months in November after Powys council's Standards Committee ruled he had breached the code of conduct.His appeal has been dismissed by the Adjudication Panel for Wales following a two-day hearing in Llandrindod Wells.Mr Price has been contacted for comment.He was found to have sent information which the council said "incorrectly and unfairly" portrayed what happened at a grievance appeal hearing, in which he was a panel member.The Adjudication Panel for Wales unanimously agreed to refer the matter back to the Standards Committee with a recommendation that Mr Price be suspended for three months.Council leader Barry Thomas said the decision "sends out a clear message that those who enter public office have to operate within the members' code of conduct and maintain the highest possible standards".^A decision to suspend a Powys county councillor has been upheld.
A social media campaign had proposed giving Halti mountain summit to Finland for its 100th birthday next year.The border between the two countries runs up the mountain near its peak.But Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said that sadly she had had to turn down the idea because the country's constitution prohibited any sacrifice of Norwegian territory.Part of Halti mountain is already in Finland - and forms its current highest point - but the peak is 20m (66ft) across the border inside Norwegian territory.Campaigners had proposed moving the border to give the summit, at 1,330m (4,363 ft), to Finland, saying the change would be barely visible on the map.They had argued that the peak "would be a wonderful gift to our sister nation" to mark its independence from Russia, and not a big loss to mountainous Norway, which has much higher peaks.The campaign's Facebook page got 17,000 likes, with support from both sides of the border.But it hit upon an insurmountable legal issue."Border adjustments between countries raise challenging legal problems, among them linked to the Norwegian constitution," Ms Solberg wrote to Svein Leiros, the mayor of the town of Kaafjord in northern Norway, who supported the campaign.Norway's  1814 constitution stipulates that the country is "indivisible" - and apparently not even an area the size of a football pitch can be split off."We will instead consider another suitable gift to Finland on its anniversary," the prime minister added.^Norway has rejected a plan to give its neighbour Finland a mountain to mark the centenary of its independence.
The move comes after Mexico drew their opening Confederations Cup game 2-2 with Portugal in Russia.Fifa has since warned the FMF about "insulting and discriminatory chants" and said it could take further action if it happens again.Mexico have already been fined eight times during World Cup qualifying because of homophobic chanting.Some fans of Mexico shout an insult at keepers when they take a goal-kick which is argued to be homophobic."As you know, Fifa is very serious about the chanting that we do when the goalkeeper takes a kick, and the possible sanctions are serious," said a statement from the FMF."Our efforts on the pitch will come to nothing if, because of this (behaviour), we lose the match, the game is suspended or you are expelled from the stadium."We lose, you lose, everyone loses."^Mexico's football federation (FMF) has asked a "small group" of its fans to stop a chant Fifa says is homophobic.
Gray opened the scoring in the 52nd minute with a fine solo goal before Slimani doubled the lead shortly after.The Algerian scored his second four minutes later as he bundled home Gray's cross from close range.Caolan Lavery's fortuitous late strike cut the deficit but Musa fired home in stoppage time.The first half was largely uneventful as both sides made eight changes from the weekend's league matches.Gray's goal was the first moment of quality in the match as he collected the ball 30-yards from goal on the left wing, drove in field and beat three defenders before slotting through Blades' goalkeeper Jake Eastwood's legs.Slimani then scored a four-minute brace which looked to have settled the tie as the striker - signed for £29m in 2016 - showed excellent movement and composure.But, Lavery pulled a goal back in the 83rd minute as his miscued cross beat Ben Hamer at the near post before the Blades pushed further with 19-year-old Foxes debutant Josh Knight making a fine block to deny Billy Sharp.The Leicester defence continued to hold strong and in the 93rd minute Musa powered through the United defence and drove home to confirm the result.Match ends, Sheffield United 1, Leicester City 4.Second Half ends, Sheffield United 1, Leicester City 4.Goal!

Wales have not beaten the All Blacks in 26 matches since 1953 and the world champions are undefeated at Eden Park since 1994.Flanker Warburton, who starts after a shoulder injury, returns to the ground for the first time since being sent off for a tip-tackle in the 2011 World Cup semi-final defeat by France."He who dares wins," Warburton said.Wales are yet to beat New Zealand on their own turf and the All Blacks have won their last 34 games at the Auckland ground.The match will be New Zealand's first since beating Australia 34-17 in the 2015 World Cup final.Steve Hansen's side are favourites to win the three-Test series, but Warburton, 27, says Wales must take the game to the home team."There are going to be opportunities in the game where it might be on to go out the back or it might be on for somebody to blitz. If it comes off it pays dividends," he said."You're going to have to take a few risks on Saturday, you can't be conservative and expect to win."Wales coach Warren Gatland added: "When the opportunity arises, we've got to be expansive, we've got to take risks and we've got to play rugby. Often the difference between one side and the other is just a bit of magic."Warburton's controversial red card against France in 2011 came as Wales' World Cup dream ended with a 9-8 defeat.But the British and Irish Lion says returning to the scene of heartbreak will not play on his psyche."There's so much water under the bridge since then. That never even crosses my mind," said Warburton."This is a brand new challenge, to play the All Blacks out here."Warburton has not played since 30 April and is one of five changes to the team beaten by England last month.The Cardiff Blues forward says he has benefited from his time on the sidelines."It's actually been a little bit of a blessing to freshen me up a bit, to top up the fitness levels," he said."I've been doing running for a long time now so fitness won't be an issue."Compared to the other injuries I've had it'll be a much easier transition back into Test rugby."^Wales captain Sam Warburton says his side must not be afraid to take risks against New Zealand on Saturday.
The choir was established by Henry VIII in 1539 and is currently made up of 20 boys and 12 adults.The Dean of Gloucester said including girl choristers would be an "exciting new chapter" in the choir's history.The aim is to find youngsters from local schools and a range of backgrounds who may not have considered singing in a cathedral choir before.Adrian Partington, director of music at Gloucester Cathedral, said the aim is to "discover" some very talented girls.New recruits will play a full part in the cathedral's musical worship, beginning with rehearsals in September before singing at evensong each Monday from October as well as at Christmas and Easter services.The dean, the Very Reverend Stephen Lake, said: "This will ensure that young girls and boys will be lifting their voices in song at Gloucester Cathedral for many years to come."The cathedral is hosting a "come and sing" open day on 9 April with girls and boys aged between seven and 12 invited to experience singing in the cathedral.Auditions for girls will be held on 23 April.^Girls are being invited to audition to join Gloucester Cathedral's Choir for the first time in its 477 year history.
Ray Houghton's tumbling goal celebration at the 1994 World Cup and Salvatore Schillaci's whoops of delight after scoring in the same fixture four years earlier are snapshots of the fervour on display.Angelo Fusco, 81, has been a keen observer of Italy's games against the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland for decades, and can boast connections linking all three.He was brought up in Belfast, educated in Dublin, and his father had strong links with the Comino Valley."I always supported Italy in football and Ireland in rugby as I went to school in Dublin at Blackrock," he said."Italy comes just a wee bit above the Irish, my mother was Irish and my dad was Italian."My brother, Carlo, supported Inter Milan and the other three brothers, myself included, supported AC Milan."I remember in 1990 when Italy won against Ireland at the World Cup, someone threw a brick through the window of a brother's shop in Belfast."My favourite Italian players have been Cesare Maldini and his son Paolo. I saw Cesare play for AC Milan in the 1963 European Cup final in London against Benfica, I went over to the match with my brothers."I also went to the Rome derby once between AS Roma and Lazio - I don't know all the Italian curses, but there was a lot of swearing around me."My brother Carlo played for Distillery, Cliftonville and Portadown in the Irish League."At Portadown he was a teammate of Wilbur Cush who went on to play at the 1958 World Cup for Northern Ireland."Angelo and his brothers witnessed the infamous 'Battle of Belfast' in December 1957, when Northern Ireland and Italy drew 2-2 in an explosive encounter at Windsor Park.Juan Schiaffino and Alcides Ghiggia, who scored Uruguay's winning goal in the 1950 World Cup final before becoming a naturalised Italian, both featured in the game.It was invalidated as a World Cup qualifier after the Hungarian referee Istvan Zolt's flight was held up by fog, but its new designation as a "friendly" did not stop tempers boiling on and off the pitch."We all, as brothers, went to the game against Northern Ireland in Belfast in 1957, we were all there supporting Italy and it was a shambles," Angelo said."It was supposed to be a World Cup match, but the referee did not turn up."In those days, the goalkeeper in Italy was sacrosanct and was not to be touched. Northern Ireland forward Peter McParland tackled the goalkeeper and took him out, the match turned on that."When the fans invaded the pitch after the match, they got one of the full-backs on the ground, Harry Gregg and some of the other Northern Ireland players got round him and shielded him."Angelo also recalled how both sets of players met up at a dance hall venue in north Belfast after the game."There was a big do at the Floral Hall at Bellevue, which was attended by players from the Italian and Northern Ireland teams," he added."We as brothers sold tickets for the dance that night. The Northern Ireland players that were there included Peter McParland, Danny and Jackie Blanchflower and Wilbur Cush."The Italian players that were there included Juan Schiaffino and Alcides Ghiggia"The match was rough, but when it is over, it is over and the players move on."Paul Loughran is one of 24 fans from the West Belfast Ireland Supporters Club who will be travelling to the Euro 2016 finals.He said a number of them would be attending the Italy v Republic of Ireland game on 22 June near Lille and highlighted the history that linked the two teams."It is always a good match, there is always a lot of excitement and tension for both sets of supporters and across the generations," he said."Ireland had Giovanni Trapattoni as manager, he was born on St Patrick's Day so that was his Irish connection, he also had Marco Tardelli who was Italian, as his assistant."Liam Brady was a big player for Ireland and he also played for Juventus in Italy and Trapattoni managed him there."Angelo, meanwhile, is just happy to soak up the occasion, whatever the result."It is great that that the three of them are there, (Italy, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) - it doesn't happen very often."^When the Republic of Ireland and Italy clash at football, passion and pride are usually not far away.

Mike Hearn, a Zurich-based developer and long-time proponent of Bitcoin, surprised many this weekend when he published a blog calling Bitcoin a "failed" project.Mr Hearn, who had until recently been working on new software for the currency, says he has now sold all of his own bitcoins and will no longer take part in the crypto-currency's development.So, is Bitcoin doomed?Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned.Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin.In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin "mining".Users have a "bitcoin address", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used.Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts.Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead.The biggest issue most bitcoin users acknowledge is how quickly new transactions can be processed.The size of blocks being added to the blockchain has been increasing steadily with the rise of Bitcoin.As a result, the rate at which transactions can be processed has been slowing.Indeed, some transactions face significant delays, hampering payments.Some fear the network will eventually become oversaturated and cease to be usable.Mike Hearn is a software developer who has worked on Bitcoin technologies for over five years.In 2014, he left his job at Google to focus on Bitcoin full time.He has worked closely with Bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen on alternative software for Bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which aims to address capacity issues facing the network.Mr Andresen is generally thought of as next in the chain of influence over the currency's development after Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.Currently, each block can be no more than 1MB.But in May last year, Mr Andresen said bigger ones should be adopted.He later wrote, "It is more likely people [will] just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable."The Bitcoin XT version developed by Mr Hearn, Mr Andresen and others offers to increase the block size limit to 8MBThere are alternatives, however.Nic Cary, co-founder of Bitcoin start-up Blockchain, points to BitcoinClassic, which would increase the block size limit to 2MB.Bitcoin's history as a "decentralised" currency has led to much hesitation over decisions that might change its fundamental nature.Any proposal relating to Bitcoin is likely to encourage fierce debate and, in some cases, stagnation.Some have argued vehemently against Bitcoin XT, causing a deep divide in the community. The New York Times has reported that death threats had even been made against some Bitcoin developers.Mr Cary says the need to update the block size limit is not as urgent as some say."This is a matter of perspective," he told the BBC."The Bitcoin network has been updated safely dozens of times and will continue to be the most reliable, affordable, and efficient way to send value around the world."However, there are some who feel that Bitcoin's potential as a currency has already been exhausted."I'm sure there are smart people right now working out what the next generation [of Bitcoin] should look like but I have to say I'm not convinced that money or payments is the optimum [use] of the technology," Dave Birch, a director at consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, told the BBC.Part of the problem was the lack of consensus over what Bitcoin was and how it should be used, he added.Bitcoin's price fell quite sharply over the weekend, following the publication of Mr Hearn's blog.One bitcoin is now worth $380 (Â£265), down from about $430 on Thursday.However, the price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile.It has been classed as the best performing currency in the world in 2015.But authors of that analysis, The Money Project, also noted it was the worst performing currency the previous year.Besides price, Bitcoin has also suffered from a litany of cases in which bitcoins have been stolen from online exchanges in which they were stored, in some cases due to negligence or poor security.Such incidents generally result in a complete loss of funds for the victims, since it is very difficult to trace where stolen bitcoins have been transferred.Meanwhile, the currency continues to grow - a sign of good things to come, say many.Bitcoin remains popular.There is still huge interest in developing both the currency and technologies based on the blockchain idea of recording data.It seems unlikely the currency will collapse overnight.But it certainly look as though fundamental questions over how Bitcoin works are now coming to a head.Whether the community that uses and supports Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus on these matters remains to be seen.Mr Hearn has lost faith in the project, of that there is no doubt.But many others are refusing to throw in the towel just yet.Update: This report was changed on 19 January 2016 to clarify that some payments can take a considerable time to be processed rather than not going through at all.^A high-profile Bitcoin developer has said the crypto-currency has failed and he will no longer take part in its development.
The 22-year-old played for Yeovil in the 2012-13 season and briefly last term, but has been studying at Rider University for the past four years."I'm incredibly excited to be back playing for my hometown club who I have supported my whole life," she said."To have the opportunity to play for them in the top division is amazing."Howard graduated two weeks ago with a major in history and a minor in French.^Women's Super League One side Yeovil Town Ladies have re-signed goalkeeper Beth Howard after she graduated from university in the United States.
"We save people here every day," said the 46-year-old policeman - managing to sound both proud and chiding and the same time.Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to the lifeguard unit that patrols the beach.At high tide on a recent Friday afternoon, thousands of mostly young Somalis were playing in the surf - a scene of cheerful relaxation that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago in a city notorious for its decades of anarchy, famine and violence."This place is bangin'! Beautiful!" said an exuberant 21-year-old named Hassan Mohammed.Like many others at the shore, he was from the diaspora and spoke English in a broad London accent."Never been here before. Very nice country. I'm born and raised in Europe. I thought it would be like seeing the end of the world. But it's improved very much," he said.Several restaurants have opened up at Lido beach, their shaded tables packed with Mogadishu's wealthier elites."Octopus, sea turtle, lobster, shrimp - it's all over this place! Somalia is the most rich in seafood," said Lule Dhan, an Ethiopian who is executive chef at the Benadir Beach Restaurant. "This fabulous city... is not what the media portrays," he declared."Absolutely, I'm here to stay," said the restaurant's slightly less effusive co-owner, Abdi Resak Jamcale, who has returned to Somalia after two decades in California."I'm not making a profit but I'm breaking even. We need new laws to have more foreign investment here. For years people here never knew what's wrong and what's right - whoever has the gun [was in control]. But we're getting there, slowly," he said.Read Andrew's other reports from Somalia:'Why I left al-Shabab'Getting round remittance bansIn a country famous for its entrepreneurial culture, Lido beach's popularity has attracted a range of new business ventures - the most visible being the stalls renting out bright red life jackets to the many less confident swimmers."When the security improves, everything gets better. Before there was no work at the seaside, but now we're very proud to have this business," said Mariam Hassan Ali, 45, sitting beside an inflated inner tube that she also rents by the hour.But if Lido beach is a clear indication of the growing sense of optimism in Mogadishu, this is not a city in which one can, or should, drop one's guard for long.Later in the afternoon, the local district police chief arrived and demanded that we leave the beach immediately, hinting darkly that our film crew might be working on behalf of al-Shabab. To reinforce his point, he was brandishing a grenade with some enthusiasm.Further down the beach, Hassan Mohammed - the young visitor from London - also began sounding slightly less emphatic about the city's charms when I asked him if he had any concerns about security, and al-Shabab."No. No. You talk about that and they'll come to you! You don't talk about that - not even a little bit. I'm scared of that. This country's un-trustable, the people are un-trustable. They're just like you but then they've got this different mentality."There's only certain people that you can trust but that's cos they're your family. Do you know what they say here [about al-Shabab]? Arsenal or Chelsea! They don't even call them by their name. They say Arsenal or Chelsea. And if you hear that, run! Run! Don't even turn around. Just run!" he said.^Abdullah Mohammed Hassan climbed down from his perch, and strolled purposefully into the sea to rescue yet another bather who appeared to be struggling against big waves and a rocky, barbed-wire-infested shoreline at Lido beach, on the northern edge of the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned.Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save rainforest from the interests of wealthy landlords.She had tried to block Moura's attempts to seize land and was shot six times.Moura, who was convicted in 2007 and 2010 in verdicts that were subsequently overturned, was sentenced to 30 years in prison.In the latest trial, the judge said Moura had acted in a cold-blooded and cowardly manner.Prosecutors earlier said Moura and another rancher had hired gunmen to kill Ms Stang. Moura's lawyers argued there wasn't enough evidence linking him to the crime.The death of Ms Stang in the northern state of Para became a symbol of the violent conflict for natural resources in Brazil's Amazon region.In the past 30 years, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land disputes in Brazil, with some two-thirds of the murders happening in Para.Ahead of the latest verdict, Ms Stang's sister, Barbara Richardson, said the repeated trials had been upsetting but had helped maintain a spotlight on the issues."That keeps the injustice of the system before the people's eyes," she told AP. "Dorothy is ever prominent. The people understand what happened to her and what this means."^A Brazilian court has convicted a rancher for ordering the murder of an American nun over a land dispute - a case that caused international outrage.
Joe Root, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali and Mark Wood also return for the tie with Pakistan at Old Trafford on 7 September after missing Sri Lanka in July.Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, James Vince, and Dawid Malan all miss out.However, rapid T20 specialist Tymal Mills retains his place.Stokes missed the tie against Sri Lanka, which England won by eight wickets, but has figured in the ongoing five-match ODI series, in which they have beaten Pakistan in the first three fixtures.England impressed at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, scoring an international ODI record 444-3.Hales scored 171 in that match, the highest score by an England batsman in limited overs cricket, while Root added 85 - his fifth consecutive ODI half-century.Liam Dawson took 3-27 on debut against Sri Lanka, but misses out as Test spinner Ali returns, while Malan drops out of the squad without making his debut.National selector, James Whitaker, said: "It is excellent to see the progress we are making in white ball cricket across both formats."It is testament to the excellent work being nurtured in the county structure and through the England Lions, that there is a depth of quality pushing the nucleus of the current group."England Twenty20 squad: Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Sam Billings (Kent), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire), Chris Jordan (Sussex), Tymal Mills (Sussex), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), Ben Stokes (Durham), David Willey (Yorkshire), Mark Wood (Durham)^Ben Stokes has returned to the England Twenty20 squad for the first time since being hit for four sixes in the final over of the World T20, when West Indies beat England.
Olly Martins said the force, which has to save Â£7.5m over the next two years, spends Â£3m a year on its buildings.But changes in policing technology meant officers could now share facilities, he added.The Police Federation said it would be concerned that officers in shops may look "unprofessional".Mr Martins said many of the county's police buildings were in need of refurbishment and no longer in the best position to serve the public, while others were under used.An online public survey opens on Friday to asses residents' views. The survey answers will help gauge support for replacing some stations with more accessible facilities in public areas such as public buildings and supermarkets.The PCC said operational policing was already running at maximum efficiency, so he must look to other areas.Changes to modern policing due to the use of technology, meant "innovative ways of increasing access to the police while reducing overheads" could be considered, he added."In the future officers will be able to carry out much of their communications and administrative tasks while on the move, which reduces the demand on premises and increases their visibility," he said.He said no decisions had been taken yet but "tough choices" needed to be made.Ray Reed from Bedfordshire Police Federation, said he was not resistant to change, but "had concerns" over response times and perception."People already complain about response times and if you close down stations it will make things worse," he said."Plus I would be worried about how police would be perceived in supermarkets, it may look unprofessional."And [in public buildings] there is a risk element as you may get someone becoming aggressive in full view of the public."[Police carry out] sensitive functions in the community and we have to think how and where we place them."^Some Bedfordshire police stations could be relocated to supermarkets to help bridge a funding gap, its Police and Crime Commissioner said.
The 42-year-old man was discovered in wetland at the Medmerry Nature Reserve, in Earnley, on Tuesday by Coastguards.Sussex Police said the incident, which took place in the Selsey area at about 17:00 GMT, was being treated as a "tragic accident".The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and British Hang Gliding Association have been informed.A spokesman for Sussex Police said they believed the AAIB would be "leading on the investigation into the cause of the crash".^A hang gliding pilot has died in an accident at a nature reserve near Chichester in West Sussex.
The man, who has not yet been identified, was last seen alive at 20:45 BST on Tuesday 9 June in St Stephen's subway.Two people saw the man, 29, in the early hours of Wednesday before he was found dead at 07:00 BST, police said.A post-mortem examination revealed he died from injuries to the spleen and the death was declared "suspicious".Det Insp Marie James said: "We are still trying to create a timeline of the man's final movements and the circumstances which led to his death."We would particularly like to hear from two people who saw the man in the early hours of Wednesday morning."Other witnesses have suggested a male teenager, possibly a college student, passed him in the subway at around 05:00 BST and later returned to buy flowers from the flower stall by the subway to leave inside."The second person we wish to trace is a man who gave assistance at the scene when his body was discovered."This man is described as being smartly dressed, wearing a jacket and glasses."I would also appeal again for people to contact me if they know details about any of his friends or family as we have still been unable to trace next of kin despite numerous inquiries."^Police investigating the death of a homeless man in a Norwich subway want to speak to two potential witnesses.
Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has asked Sir Richard Henriques to make recommendations about whether there are ways to improve procedures.The Operation Midland inquiry into a 1970s and 1980s paedophile ring is among inquiries that will be examined.The force has come under fire amid claims it over-reacted to allegations.Former head of the Army Lord Bramall, 92, who last month found out he would not face any further action in connection with Operation Midland, had called for a review.His solicitor Drew Pettifer said Lord Bramall welcomed any review that would make "the process fairer and less painful".The peer strongly denied claims made by a man given the name "Nick", and said detectives had taken 10 months before speaking to witnesses who cast doubt on the case.There has also been scrutiny of the Met Police's handling of an investigation into a rape allegation against the late Lord Brittan, a former Home Secretary. He died in January 2015 without being told that the case had been dropped.Critics have questioned whether Sir Bernard's contract, up in September this year, should be renewed.Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz has asked that he appear in front of MPs to answer questions about the Met's handling of the cases.Analysis: Press turns both barrels on the Met PoliceSir Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, told BBC Newsnight he felt some of the criticism Sir Bernard was receiving was unfair and that he was a "remarkable police leader".However, he said that in the same position he would apologise to Lord Britten's wife for the delay in informing him his case had been dropped."There is clearly a particular issue about a delay... that is a clear mistake, an error. It is not how the procedure should work," he said."But I certainly think that no chief constable would apologise for investigating anybody."Former Conservative children's minister Tim Loughton said allegations needed investigating quickly and a decision made quickly so people were "not left in the public domain hung out to dry and not given natural justice".The judge's review will contain confidential and sensitive information and will be a private report for Sir Bernard, but its key findings and the recommendations will be made public later this year.It will look at police procedure rather than evidence.Sir Bernard said: "We are not afraid to learn how we can do these things better."Sir Richard brings an independent legal mind to advise us whether we can provide a better balance between our duty to investigate and the interests of suspects, complainants and victims."He said Judge Lowell Goddard, who is chairing the wide-ranging independent inquiry into child sex abuse, had been notified of the review.The announcement of the Henriques review is a significant moment.  The Met Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe is asking the judge: "Did we get it right or did we get it wrong?" when responding to allegations of child sexual abuse.The idea is that this review will be able to answer the question fully and fairly because it will have access to confidential information not available to the Met's critics, especially those in the press.Sir Richard Henriques has already decided police investigating Lord Janner in Leicester didn't do enough - now he will have to decide if the Met went too far, especially its most sensitive investigation, Operation Midland.The fact that Sir Bernard has not waited until Operation Midland is complete to order this review, will be seen as a sign that it has failed.  He will be hoping for a more positive verdict.Operation Midland, established in November 2014, is examining claims that boys were abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies at locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s.It is also examining claims that three boys were murdered. Operation Midland has focused on the Dolphin Square estate in Pimlico, south-west London.Sir Richard recently carried out a review of sex abuse allegations against the former Labour MP Lord Janner, which concluded prosecutors had been wrong not to have charged the late peer 25 years ago.Lord Janner's family have denied the allegations.A spokesman for children's charity the NSPCC said it was crucial the review into the Met Police investigations did not "inadvertently discourage" victims of abuse from coming forward.Gabrielle Shaw, from the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac), said if the police could learn from past mistakes and get better at their job, that could only benefit society.^A former High Court judge is to review the Metropolitan Police's handling of cases involving claims of historical child abuse by public figures.
Pae Jun-ho, known in the US as Kenneth Bae, smuggled anti-government materials and plotted the state's downfall, a Supreme Court spokesman told state news agency KCNA.He denied Mr Bae was being used as a "political bargaining chip" with the US.Mr Bae was detained last year after entering North Korea as a tourist.North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytism.They were released after intervention from high-profile American figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both of whom went to Pyongyang.The court spokesman told KCNA that Mr Bae was "dispatched to China as a missionary".There he was involved in setting up "plot-breeding bases" from which he "infiltrated at least 250 students" into the North Korean port city of Rason with the aim of "bringing the government down".US citizens held by N Korea"He committed such hostile acts as egging on overseas [North Korean] citizens and foreigners to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign," he said.He added Mr Bae's full confession was the reason why he did not receive a possible death sentence."He dared commit such hideous crimes as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership," he said.The spokesman denied that Mr Bae was "not tried in a transparent matter and [the North] was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip".Mr Bae, 44, was arrested in November as he entered Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China.South Korea activists believe he was arrested for taking pictures of starving children. Other reports have described him as a devout Christian.His conviction on 30 April came amid high tension between the US and North Korea, after Pyongyang's third nuclear test.The UN expanded sanctions against the communist state in March, in the wake of its 12 February nuclear test and December long-range rocket launch.Pyongyang reacted angrily both to the measures and the annual US-South Korea military exercises, threatening to attack US military bases and cutting key hotlines with its southern neighbour.^North Korea has released details of the alleged crimes of a US man it sentenced to 15 years of hard labour.
Newport's win over Accrington sees the Exiles leapfrog Pools, putting them two points in front with two games remaining.Victory for Barnet, under caretaker boss Rossi Eames, was only their second win in 13 games.But they controlled the match throughout against a side lacking in confidence, belief and ability.John Akinde was denied an opener after 12 minutes when his angled header was tipped over for a corner.From the set-piece Michael Nelson, the Barnet skipper, fired a shot against a post, while Jack Taylor's goal-bound shot was deflected wide.Nathan Thomas got Pools' first shot on target after 64 minutes, failing to test goalkeeper Josh Vickers.And the Bees went ahead in the 66th minute when Akinde turned and powerfully fired an angled drive past goalkeeper Joe Fryer.Simeon Akinola made it two five minutes later, the Bees racing away down the left side and Jamal Campbell-Ryce setting up the substitute.Akinde also missed a penalty, Fryer saving his weak spot kick with nine minutes remaining.Match report supplied by the Press Association.Match ends, Hartlepool United 0, Barnet 2.Second Half ends, Hartlepool United 0, Barnet 2.Attempt blocked.

The new plan is for training to be split across three different sites.There would be some joint training, but the three services would each have their own facilities.The big winner would be the fire and rescue service - it would get a £44m purpose-built complex at Desertcreat, near Cookstown in County Tyrone.Timeline: Ten years of stop and start for NI's public services collegeThe BBC revealed in March that a programme board in charge of the Desertcreat project had concluded it was no longer economically viable.It said the joint college as originally planned was no longer needed because of reduction in the number of training days required by each of the three services.The Office of First and deputy First Minister then asked for a revised business case, setting out preferred options for future training needs.That review has now been completed and the BBC has obtained a copy of a draft report setting out the board's recommendations.It says the preferred option is for the fire service to have a training facility at Desertcreat at an estimated cost of £44m.If the plan is approved by the Northern Ireland Executive, it is understood the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) would also be allocated about £20m to refurbish its existing training facilities at Garnerville police station in east Belfast.The Northern Ireland Prison Service would be given funding for training at Maghaberry and Magilligan prisons as its training centre in Millisle, County Down, has been closed.The proposed new complex for the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) would be built on the site bought 10 years ago for a new policing college at Desertcreat.That plan was later changed to include the fire and prison services, but has now been revised.It would include what is called a 'hot house'.This is a building that can be set on fire in a controlled fashion, or heated to extremely high temperatures, to give firefighters realistic training.Northern Ireland does not currently have such a facility.The NIFRS would like it to have different sections to replicate the different conditions and challenges involved when tackling a blaze in domestic homes, commercial premises and high-rise buildings.The money for all of the training facilities would have to be provided by the executive.That is because a £53m funding package from the Treasury was withdrawn earlier this year due to a failure to build the proposed joint college within a stipulated timeframe.The programme board's report will be sent to Justice Minister David Ford and Health Minister Simon Hamilton for their approval as their departments are responsible for the project.In a statement to the BBC, a project steering group said the draft business case "has yet to be finalised or formally signed-off" by the accounting officers for the fire and prison services and the PSNI.But senior officials from the departments of justice and health sit on the programme board and were heavily involved in producing the draft report.If Mr Ford and Mr Hamilton endorse the preferred option, they will make a joint recommendation to the executive by the end of November.^A planned state-of-the-art joint training college for Northern Ireland's police, fire and prison services has been radically redrawn.
Archibald was on Swindon Town's managerial shortlist last season and has been linked with other vacancies.Osman says the loss of Archibald - who guided Thistle to a top six finish last season - would be a hard act to follow."Since I signed, he's only got better, every season. It's no surprise teams are interested in him," Osman said."We don't want him to go anywhere. He's probably one of the best managers I have played under.The boys love him. We just pray he stays here for another season."Osman's Partick Thistle team-mate Adam Barton echoes his captain's sentiments."I would be personally disappointed because what he has done is really good," the midfielder said."As a footballer, you like managers who really stick by their players. You come across so many managers who chop and change things and I have been through that many managers that many times."New managers come in and they don't even want to see you play, they just want to bring their own players in and chop and change. To see him go would not be a good thing."Partick Thistle are on the verge of losing promising centre-back Liam Lindsay, who has travelled to Barnsley for a medical following the clubs agreeing a fee for the player.Subject to the completion of the medical, Lindsay will sign a three-year deal at Oakwell.^Partick Thistle captain Abdul Osman says the players are praying manager Alan Archibald stays at the club for another season.
Iain Duncan Smith, in what he said was his first interview on Europe in 10 years, has just told me that staying in the EU puts us at increased risk of an appalling attack like the terrorist killings in Paris, while the prime minister was on the TV sofa this morning saying that we are safer in the union.This is the new, if temporary reality: cabinet ministers disagreeing totally with each other on the record, and in public. Traditionally unthinkable, certainly risky, and difficult to control.Plenty of disagreements are spilling out into the public domain now. After lots of speculation, Boris Johnson has just declared he'll be campaigning for Britain to leave the EU. But many are still wondering about the motivations that lie behind his decision.Unless Machiavellian machinations deep in the Conservative party interest you, you probably shouldn't read much further. But believe me, on long days in Westminster, this is the kind of hypothesising that concerns politicians and their teams.Ready?Conspiracy One - Michael Gove's decision to go with the Vote Leave campaign was taken to make sure that Chancellor George Osborne will be challenged in the eventual Tory leadership by someone who is a chum, who looks on him favourably, but who would get onto the final ballot (which crucially only has two contenders) as someone who can claim to the party membership which is broadly Eurosceptic, that they fought to leave the EU, even though they were then sadly defeated.This, so Conspiracy One goes, is why Mr Gove's decision to join Vote Leave has not impressed some true believers in the cause and, in any case, his public image may well not be a benefit to them.Conspiracy Two - Doing the rounds inside Number 10 and Number 11 (the chancellor's abode) so the theory goes, is that Boris is intent on becoming 'The Man Who Tried'. What? Well, Downing Street has concluded that Mr Johnson is going for Leave precisely because he is confident that they will lose.This allows him to create the perfect platform for his leadership ambition - campaign for Leave, Remain wins, but Boris manages to then glide onto the leadership ballot as the man who gave it his damnedest, didn't quite pull it off, but can scoop up oodles of votes from the broken-hearted Tory membership, despairing in defeat, but ready to go over the top for their hero.This kills Mr Gove, or anyone else's chances of opposing Mr Osborne in the final round of the leadership contest.If you got this far, and feel enlightened by it all, then marvellous. If it seems fanciful, then don't say I didn't warn you!But with the prime minister having already announced that he's leaving his job before the next election, there is no escaping the fact that the future of the Tory leadership is a factor in both sides' campaigns.^Forgive me if you are not a fan of political conspiracy, and on a day like today you don't have to look very far for huge ideological disputes, even if they're not quite yet punch-ups.
Ece Heper, 50, was arrested on 30 December in the north-eastern town of Kars, her lawyer Sertac Celikkaleli told The Canadian Press.Canadian officials say they are offering consular assistance, but released no further information.Turkey's penal code states that anybody who insults the president can face up to four years in prison.Ms Heper's friend Emrah Bayram told the BBC she was arrested for Facebook posts critical of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan."It's ridiculous, she's expressing her opinion," he said.Friends say Ms Heper, who lived in Ontario and is reportedly a Canadian-Turkish citizen, has "some health issues" and they are worried about her access to medication while in detention.Along with her lawyer, they fear it could be at least a month before her case goes to trial. They have contacted human rights organisations over her case.Mr Erdogan has been accused of mounting a growing crackdown on freedom of speech.Almost 2,000 cases for insulting Mr Erdogan have been opened in recent years.They include a former Miss Turkey and a 16-year-old student.Another man was found guilty of insulting the president and given a suspended one-year jail sentence after he shared images comparing Mr Erdogan to the fictional character Gollum.^A Canadian dual national has reportedly been detained in Turkey for allegedly insulting the country's president.
The new Manchester City striker headed the Elephants in front from a right-wing cross by Max Gradel.Hilal Soudani equalised for Algeria against the run of play early in the second half and then forced goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo into a brilliant save.Gbohouo was rewarded when Bony headed in Yaya Toure's free-kick and Junior Tallo set up Gervinho for a late third.The margin of victory flattered Ivory Coast in what was an even contest and before former Arsenal striker Gervinho confirmed the result on the break, they had been under pressure from Algeria.Their defence seemed all over the place at times and semi-final opponents DR Congo will have taken note.Algeria, in the quarter-finals for the first time since 2010, made the brighter start to the contest and almost went ahead in the ninth minute.Yacine Brahimi raced into the left-hand side of the penalty area and the Elephants' defence failed to deal with his cross, allowing Soudani to get in a shot which was well held by Gbohouo.In the 21st minute, Riyad Mahrez volleyed over from close range but then Ivory Coast hit back.Two minutes later, Gradel floated in a free-kick from the left and Serge Aurier's downward header hit the base of the post and then in the 26th minute they took the lead.Gradel was again involved as he delivered a testing cross from the right and Bony escaped the defence to head home from eight yards.Bony shot wide from distance towards the end of the first half before at the other end, Saphir Taider's sharp volley was confidently saved by Gbohouo.The start of the second half mirrored the start of the first with one team dominating but the other one scoring.This time Ivory Coast were the team who started on top but a comedy of errors in their defence after a deep cross into their penalty area finally saw the ball fall to Soudani, who fired it home.That sparked a spell of dominance from the Desert Foxes with Gbohouo twice having to clear his lines before he made an amazing 66th minute save from Soudani's point-blank effort.The momentum changed and two minutes later Bony restored Ivory Coast's lead when he climbed highest to head Yaya Toure's set-piece inside the near post.Algeria piled on the pressure in the closing stages but could not find an equaliser and Gervinho finished them off when he passed the ball into the net.^Wilfried Bony scored twice to take Ivory Coast into the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations.
The Taiwanese firm, also known as Foxconn Technology, posted a net profit of NT$37bn ($1.2bn; Â£814m) in the October to December quarter.It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to NT$94.8bn.Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and Apple is one of its biggest clients.According to some estimates, orders from Apple account for almost half of Foxconn's total revenue.In the October to December quarter, Apple had sold 47.8 million iPhones, up from 37 million a year earlier.Meanwhile, the launch of iPad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet PCs - it sold 22.9 million iPads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011.However, the heavy reliance on Apple has also raised concerns that Foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months.Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained."In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage," said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan.Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets.He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers.At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets."They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China," he said.The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn.^Hon Hai Precision Industry, a major assembler of Apple products, has posted record quarterly profits helped by growing demand for iPhones and iPads.
What did the court say?Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work.On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day.The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive.I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected?Possibly, yes.Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as "mobile workers" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected.Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category.As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC.And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds.I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent officeThe ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says.There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office.I have to commute two hours every day to my officeFor those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the "overwhelming majority" in the UK.I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours?The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account).That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up.It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum."I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have," Mr Tutton said.We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling.Here is a selection of their comments:This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, ManchesterI am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, CambridgeI am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, SwindonI currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, GlasgowI am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, CastlefordI'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our "pickup" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, DorsetI am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, BarnsleyI'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere. Susan Bird, Kent^Time spent travelling to and from first and last jobs by workers who do not have a fixed office should be regarded as work, European judges have ruled.
Firefighters spent several days at the site in Duncan Street following the blaze on 2 March, which reduced train services and caused travel delays.The Environment Agency (EA) suspended Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited from accepting waste after the fire.The firm was "broadly compliant" with fire safety law, the fire service said.Recovered Fuels Shipping Limited, whose site was run by Asset and Land Group, could not be contacted for a comment. It has until 7 August to appeal the decision.Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.Geoff Harris, GMFRS area manager, said: "The site operators, Asset and Land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."The fire service raised concerns to the EA in February over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment."The EA were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with EA staff, the EA decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," Mr Harris said.An EA spokesman said: "After consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the EA has now decided to revoke the environmental permit."Subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 August, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site. The company is still required to remove all the waste."The cause of the fire remains undetermined.^A company which runs a paper recycling plant in Salford where a major fire broke out has had its environmental permit revoked.
It was unanimously passed by MPs in December, but Mr Koroma refused to sign it after protests by religious leaders.After consultations, MPs returned the bill to him last month, unaltered.The law would allow women to terminate a pregnancy in any circumstances up to 12 weeks and in cases of incest, rape and foetal impairment up to 24 weeks.Abortion is currently illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances.Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and five Sierra Leonean organisations, wrote to President Koroma in February urging him to give the bill his assent."Unsafe abortions - often resulting from restrictive laws and poor access to sexual and reproductive health services, information, and education - is one of the main factors contributing to maternal deaths in Sierra Leone," their letter said.The World Health Organization estimates that Sierra Leone has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio at 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births last year.The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says the abortion issue has led to heated debates and protests on both sides.President Koroma has now referred the controversial legislation to the Constitutional Review Committee, which is currently reviewing the constitution.Our correspondent says it will decide whether to include the abortion law in its recommended changes to the constitution, which will be put to a referendum.When President Koroma sent the legislation back to parliament in January, he asked for it to be reviewed after consultation with religious and women's groups as it went beyond an African Union protocol on women's rights which only backs abortion in cases of sexual assault and in medical emergencies.Under Sierra Leone's current constitution, the president cannot veto a bill which received a two-thirds majority in parliament, our reporter says.The speaker of the house could sign the Safe Abortion Act into law, but our correspondent says he is highly unlikely to do so as he comes from the president's party.Mr Koroma met leaders from the Inter Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL), who all oppose abortion, in January, saying they "represent a huge constituency across the country".Catholic Archbishop Tamba Charles, vice-president of IRCSL, reiterated their view at summit on the issue later in the month declaring: "No life can be destroyed on the basis of choice as life is sacred."If they want to fight for the right of women, then let them be provided with the required medical facilities that will help reduce maternal mortality rate in the country," Sierra Leone's Politico news website quotes him as saying.Our reporter says the recent Ebola outbreak exposed Sierra Leone's weak health system.The country is still recovering from a brutal 10-year civil war, which ended in 2002 and ravaged much of its infrastructure.^Sierra Leone's President Ernest Bai Koroma has again refused to sign a bill legalising abortion, saying it should be put to a referendum.
But there are about 500 deaths a year in the UK from cardiac arrest among the under-30s.When it happens it is shocking. Doubly so when it affects a sports star like 23-year-old Fabrice Muamba.He is said to be one of the fittest players at his club, Bolton Wanderers.The same sentiments were expressed about Marc-Vivien Foe, the Cameroon footballer who collapsed and died during an international match in 2003.But the underlying cause of such deaths are likely to be inherited rather than a reflection on their fitness.Genetic abnormalities are usually associated with arrhythmias - irregular heart beats - or cardiomyopathies, which is a disease of the heart muscle.But where sport can play a role is on the likelihood of these conditions leading to a cardiac arrest.The evidence is not clear-cut.But research has suggested that those with inherited conditions are twice as likely to suffer a cardiac arrest if they play sport at a high level.Dr Leonard Shapiro, a consultant cardiologist and medical adviser to the Football Association, says it is always difficult to know exactly what triggers the attack.But he says: "There is a predisposition in some individuals to have a cardiac event under very high physical and emotional stress."The question that is always asked after such events is whether anything can be done to prevent them.Many sports in Britain regularly screen top athletes, although it is not mandatory as it is in some countries such as Italy.In football, players are checked at 16 and then are likely to have regular check-ups as their career goes on.Those that are diagnosed with a problem often have to give up top-level sport.Sports cardiologist Sanjay Sharma, who also works for the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young, says the tests are thorough, but not perfect."It involves taking a history relating to cardiac symptoms, which include chest pain during exertion or breath which is disproportionate to the amount of exercise being performed, and blackouts, and asking about a family history because many of these conditions that can cause cardiac arrest are hereditary."We then perform a cardiac examination and following that we do an ECG (electrocardiogram), which is an electrical tracing of the heart which looks for electric faults of the heart, and a cardiac ultrasound, which looks at heart muscle problems or problems with the heart valves."However, they do not guarantee that an abnormality will be picked up.The difficulty is that such abnormalities are not always permanent.They can come and go - as the Muamba case suggests. It has been reported that the Bolton player had four such screenings during his career, the latest of which was done last summer.^Most people associate heart problems - and cardiac arrest in particular - with older people.
Albert Anthony Smith McDonald, 58, was found with head injuries on Cumbernauld Road, Riddrie, at 21:25 on Monday. He died on his way to hospital.Officers said the car driver is assisting with their inquiries.Police said Mr McDonald's family were "completely devastated" by his death and appealed for information.Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie said earlier: "We are following up several lines of inquiry, including speaking to local residents and accessing CCTV from around Cumbernauld Road and the surrounding area."She added that "Mr McDonald had significant injuries" when he was found and the investigating team was "trying to establish just how he sustained them".She said officers were trying to piece together his last known movements."Understandably his family and friends are completely devastated, and specialist officers are providing them with support at this tragic time," she said."It is imperative we find who is responsible for Albert's death."I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of Cumbernauld Road around 21:30 or earlier, and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward to police."Det Ch Insp McLuckie added: "You may think that the information you have is insignificant however it may be the piece of information we are looking for."^Police investigating the murder of a man who was found seriously injured on a Glasgow street have traced the driver of a car seen near where he was found.
Media playback is not supported on this devicePlatini wants to restore the image of world football's governing body in the wake of serious corruption allegations."We want a reform candidate," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "We believe he will reform Fifa in the way that reform is needed."Sepp Blatter has already announced he will quit as Fifa president, with an election set for 26 February.Frenchman Platini, president of European football governing body Uefa, is likely to face a number of challengers, among them Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan and Liberian FA president Musa Bility.Dyke added: "We understand there will be a number of candidates, which should result in a strong and healthy debate."However, we should not underestimate how challenging it will be for anyone to lead an organisation that has been so tainted. The whole structure of Fifa must be reviewed and fundamentally changed."Platini has found himself at odds with the FA over Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.The 60-year-old championed the Gulf nation despite concerns over its human rights record and severe summer temperatures.But Dyke attempted to play down any differences for the time being, saying: "Mr Platini has always made it very clear that he voted for Qatar."If all the other people who voted for Qatar had been quite as transparent it would have been more helpful."Not everyone shares the FA's confidence in Platini, a former France international who won the coveted Ballon d'Or three times.Just hours after confirming his candidacy on Wednesday, he was criticised by two potential presidential rivals.Prince Ali and Bility both claim Platini would be a bad choice as a successor.Prince Ali, who stood against Blatter in the last presidential election, said that "football's fans and players deserve better".A member of the Jordanian royal family, he added that Fifa needed a "new, independent leadership, untainted by the practices of the past".Bility agreed, telling the BBC's World Football programme that Platini would bring "chaos", "more division" and "more problems".^The English Football Association has given its backing to Michel Platini's bid to become the next boss of Fifa.
Martin Foran, 71 and from Manchester, served a total of 18 years in prison but was twice cleared on appeal.The Ministry of Justice said it only pays compensation when a conviction is quashed "because of a new fact."But, Mr Foran says despite being found innocent his ordeal has left him ill and unable to pay basic bills.Mr Foran was convicted in 1978 of robbery following an investigation by the since discredited West Midlands Serious Crime Squad.He was portrayed as an IRA member by a regional paper and served six years of a 10-year sentence. The conviction was finally quashed last year.Between his release and his successful appeal, he was found guilty in 1985 of robbing a Birmingham pub landlord.That conviction was quashed on appeal in 2013, but not before he had served 12 years inside, during which time he spent 47 days in a rooftop protest and hunger strike at Nottingham jail.His wife Valerie even scaled a nearby roof in a show of solidarity.Last year, Mr Foran held a three-week protest outside the Ministry of Justice in London as part of his compensation fight.He said he was told the justice secretary would speak to the West Midlands chief constable, but has not heard any update about this since.Speaking exclusively to the BBC, he said the London protest "nearly killed me"."It is affecting my health but I will continue fighting to my grave. My health is worsening."He added: "I've had to walk the streets trying to find a solicitor who would represent me on a no-win no-fee basis. It has been soul-destroying."I can't even afford to run the car and the phone is about to be cut off. I'm also behind with the gas and electricity bill."Mr Foran said his dying wish is to get an apology for his family."It destroys me that no-one has apologised to my wife Valerie and children for what has happened as they have suffered more than I have," he added."I would like to be able to go on holiday with my wife and enjoy what time we have left, but I cannot do this."Speaking about Mr Foran's case, a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "The fact that a conviction has been quashed by the Court of Appeal does not mean it was necessarily a miscarriage of justice."The BBC has yet to receive a response from West Midlands Police.^A terminally-ill cancer patient who was jailed for two robberies he did not commit is fighting for compensation a year after he was exonerated.
He told the United Nations General Assembly that world leaders, notably Germany and Canada, have vowed to double the number from last year."We are facing a crisis of epic proportion," Mr Obama said.About 21 million refugees have been forced to flee their countries due to conflict or persecution, the UN says.Nine million people alone have been displaced by the six-year conflict in Syria while more than four million others have fled the war-torn country."We cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs. To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values," he added.The US has agreed to take in 110,000 new refugees in the 2017 fiscal year - which begins on 1 October- compared with the 85,000 refugees it expects by the end of September.The president's remarks come a day after a US and Russia-brokered ceasefire unravelled, partly due to a US-led air strike over the weekend that mistakenly killed Syrian soldiers.Tensions continued on Monday when a strike, which witnesses say came from the air, hit an aid convoy at Urum al-Kubra, destroying 18 UN lorries and killing about 20 civilians.The UN has since suspended all aid convoys to Syria in response.Both Russia and Syria have insisted their forces were not behind the strike.The president's announcement also included a pledge by countries to increase financial contributions to UN appeals and humanitarian groups by about $4.5b (Â£3.5b) over 2015 levels.Participating countries have vowed to help fund schools for a million refugee children as well as assist in helping one million refugees work legally.Mr Obama used his eighth and final UN address as president to call for a "course correction" to ensure that extremism and violence does not drive countries into a more divided world."Together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home," he said.Though he made no direct mention of the US, Mr Obama said wealthy countries with the resources should do more to help.In what appeared to be a dig at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he added: "The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies."Hours earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also expressed concern over the conflict in Syria, saying there was "no military solution"."Gulfs of mistrust divide citizens from their leaders. Extremists push people into camps of 'us' and 'them'," Mr Ban said, taking the world stage for the last time as secretary general."The Earth assails us with rising seas, record heat and extreme storms. And danger defines the days of many."^US President Barack Obama has announced a pledge by 50 nations to take in 360,000 refugees from war-torn countries this year.
The Confederation of African Football (Caf) are inviting new bidders for the tournament.Caf say that countries wishing to host the tournament have until 30 September to express their interest.A decision on Libya's replacement will be made next year.African football's ruling body also state that because of the limited time left to organise the 2017 Nations Cup, the Caf Executive Committee will select a host country who can guarantee that accommodation, transportation and hotel facilities, as well as training sites and stadiums already exist.Libya has endured weeks of recent chaos as the government struggles to control former rebel groups who helped topple former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.Libya were originally scheduled to hold the Nations Cup in 2013 but because of the civil war swapped with 2017 hosts South Africa.The north African country had been planning to build 11 stadiums at a cost of $314 million, including a showpiece new 60,000-seater Austrian-built stadium on the site of a former military camp in Tripoli.Benghazi and Misrata were also set to have new major stadiums.Libya's government said last year it hoped the hosting of the Nations Cup would allow it to demonstrate that life had returned to normal in the country and encourage investors.Former World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer had accepted a role as an "ambassador" to help promote the tournament and the country and the former Spain coach Javier Clemente was hired to prepare their team for the tournament.Caf's decision follows the visit of a delegation from the Libyan FA to Caf's headquarters in Cairo this week.Libya also delayed the scheduled start of their new league season earlier this month because of the fighting while teams competing in international competitions in recent months have been holding home matches in neighbouring Tunisia.In February, Libya claimed their first senior African title, winning the 2014 African Nations Championship (CHAN), a tournament they were originally set to host.  The civil unrest in the country meant that the event ended up taking place in South Africa instead.Caf are due to decide the host countries for the 2019 and 2021 Nations Cup finals at a meeting in Addis Ababa on 20 September.Algeria, Cameroon, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Zambia are bidding.^Libya have withdrawn as hosts of the 2017 African Nations Cup finals as ongoing fighting in the country delays plans to build new stadiums for the 16-team tournament.
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) suspended Russia from the Rio Games starting on 7 September because of state-sponsored doping.Putin said the ruling was "cynical" and "humiliates those who take such decisions".Only Russian track and field athletes were banned from the Olympics.Putin, speaking at an award ceremony for Russian Olympians at the Kremlin, said the country would hold special competitions for banned Paralympic athletes, with the winners awarded the same prizes as in Rio.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russian Paralympians had taken "collective responsibility for an unproven crime".^Russian President Vladimir Putin says the country's Paralympics ban is "outside the bounds of law, morality and humanity".
Media playback is not supported on this deviceWorld number one Selby, the 2014 champion, looked impressive as he went 3-0 ahead with half-century breaks in frames two and three.Hong Kong's Fu hit back with a 72, and the pair shared four frames after the mid-session interval.China's Ding Junhui leads Alan McManus 6-2 in the other semi-final.Both Ding and Fu are hoping to become the first Asian player to win the sport's showpiece event.But Fu's chances appear fainter than Ding's after a characteristically dogged effort by Leicester's Selby in the best-of-33 contest.World number 14 Fu began anxiously, perhaps affected by the late jitters that saw him surrender a 9-1 lead in his 13-11 win over Barry Hawkins.Selby won a scrappy opener in which both men wasted a couple of chances, and he also took the second frame with a diligent 56.At 3-0 behind Fu made the most of a decent opening to score a well-constructed 72 before pinching a thrilling fifth frame full of incredible escapes, missed chances and numerous flukes.A 31-minute frame then went Selby's way for him to lead to 4-2 before they shared the final two frames, Fu with a fluent 89 and Selby scoring 69.Fu fought back impressively to keep alive his chances of going one better than Thailand's James Wattana - the first player from Asia to reach the last four at the Crucible.In 1993, the same year as the first of Wattana's two appearances, McManus graced that stage of the event for the second timeBut, 23 years on, the veteran Scot's hopes of progressing further look slim.Ding was in intimidating form from the start, opening with a break of 100 and scoring two further tons and two half-centuries to go 5-0 up.McManus, at 45, the oldest man to reach a Crucible semi-final since Ray Reardon in 1985, had scored just 47 points.But he showed his tactical nous to win two lengthy frames and get back to 5-2, before Ding ended with a 128.McManus did little wrong in the first five frames, but had every minor mistake punished by the world number 17.Ding had to win three qualifying rounds to reach this stage, but seems to have benefited from the extra table time.The 29-year-old has looked increasingly sharp, and has stayed fresh thanks to his fluent form which earned him an extra day's rest for beating Mark Williams inside two sessions in the quarter-finals.John Parrott, 1991 world champion: "Ding was superb. His break building and his match play has been fantastic. But I think he needed to win the last frame. The way he dominated the session, if he hadn't come out of it at least 6-2 he would have been kicking himself."^Mark Selby made the most of a tentative start by Marco Fu to build a 5-3 lead in the opening session of their World Championship semi-final.
The much-anticipated film sparked controversy last week after it emerged it would feature a "gay moment".It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a "review" of its content.The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with "a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film".Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is "ridiculous".A new release date has yet to be announced.   The live-action remake was granted a "P13 parental guidance classification"."We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened," LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said."However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not."Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance.Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the "exclusively gay moment" in the film.It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story.The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it "stupid and laughable"."Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes," wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets.Priyanka Laxmiâ€^The release of Disney's Beauty and the Beast has been postponed in Malaysia.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceWorld champion Hamilton started from the back, suffered a broken front wing on lap one and did five pit stops.The Briton faces the prospect of trying to overhaul a 36-point deficit in the remaining 18 races of the season.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came second despite colliding with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on the first lap.The incident damaged both cars, with Raikkonen fighting back to fifth behind the Red Bulls of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo.Raikkonen's rise through the field included passing Hamilton in the closing stages, Ferrari's decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the mediums chosen by Mercedes giving the Finn an advantage as the Briton fought in vain to try to pass the Williams of Felipe Massa.Hamilton will express his confidence at being able to erode Rosberg's points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turnaround - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the World Championship.The race was shaped by an incident-packed opening, with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four.By that stage, Hamilton and Raikkonen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first-corner collisions.Raikkonen moved right into Vettel's path as the German moved left to ensure he was not tagged by an aggressive dive down the inside by Kvyat.Hamilton was then turned into by Sauber's Felipe Nasr as he avoided Raikkonen's damaged car swerving back on to the circuit.Vettel confronted Kvyat about the incident in the pre-podium room after the race, saying: "If I don't go left, you crash into us and we all three go out - you are like a torpedo."Kvyat replied: "We didn't crash." Vettel responded: "You didn't. You were lucky this time." Kvyat shrugged: "I'm on the podium; you're on the podium."In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: "You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium."Listen to Vettel's post-race rantAt the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner.In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front.Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.Listen to the first-lap madnessHamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race.So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr."The car was pretty damaged," said the 31-year-old afterwards. "I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place."Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a "lot of aerodynamic performance".After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.Chinese Grand Prix race resultsChinese Grand Prix coverage details^Nico Rosberg took his third straight win of 2016 as Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton fought back to seventh in a hectic Chinese Grand Prix.
Officials say 108 tons of corn will be delivered by the end of the weekend.Last month, eight people were killed in Oaxaca in clashes between the demonstrators and police.The protesters oppose reforms that allow the federal authorities to remove teachers who fail evaluation exams.Members of the CNTE union, which has a history of radical activism, have been blocking roads in Oaxaca and other states ever since the union leaders were arrested in early June.The roadblocks have prevented food deliveries to some remote areas in the region, the government says."There are no products," says Araceli Hernandez Ramirez, manager of a grocery store in Puente de Coyula.She says she has no rice, corn or flour to sell to her customers. "They go home empty-handed," she said.In a strongly worded message on Friday, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said the unrest had hurt millions of people and "the blockades and damages to the citizenry must end"."The time is up," he said, warning that "the necessary decisions will soon be taken to allow transit on strategic roads".The CNTE union opposes education reforms introduced by President Enrique Pena Nieto in 2013.The changes include new measures to assess teachers' performance.^Mexico's air force has been flying tons of grain into Oaxaca state in the south of the country to deal with dwindling food supplies caused by roadblocks set up by protesting teachers.
The Amateur International Boxing Association has said pro boxers will compete in Rio if a constitutional change is agreed next month.But Tyson, 49, a former Junior Olympic winner, said: "Some pro fighters are going to get beat by the amateurs."It's just going to happen, I really believe that."Tyson won gold at the 1981 and 1982 Junior Olympics and, speaking at the 33rd IBF convention in China, said professional boxers would find the fast-paced fighting style of their amateur counterparts difficult to contend with."If they are like the amateur fighters that I was fighting in the 80s... they are going to beat some of the champions, it's just going to happen," he insisted.Lennox Lewis, another former world heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medallist, is also not in favour of the idea, branding it "preposterous".Tyson has also revealed he is an admirer of Briton and controversial current world champion Tyson Fury.Fury ended Wladimir Klitschko's nine-year reign as champion in November but has become better know since for a string of outspoken remarks."One guy, Tyson Fury, I like to watch him because he has my name and stuff," Tyson said. "Everybody says 'ah, he's a bum', but I like him."He beat Klitschko, so what are you going to say? That this guy is still a bum, but he beat the greatest fighter in the last 15 years?"^Former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson says the idea of professional boxers at the Olympics is "ridiculous" - because they would lose to amateurs.
The 27-year-old pleaded not guilty at Durham Crown Court to three counts of sexual activity with a child under 16 and another of grooming.The winger, who has played 12 times for England, was arrested in March.Johnson, from Castle Eden, County Durham, was released on conditional bail ahead of his trial on 24 August.The three counts of sexual activity relate to a single night in January at two locations in County Durham, while the grooming offence was said to have happened between December and February.Born in Sunderland, Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.^England and Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson has appeared in court to deny charges of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.
The latest Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.7 last month, down from January's reading of 55.6.Any figure above 50 means expansion, but the rise in service sector activity was the weakest since March 2013.The service sector accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy.Surveys from Markit/CIPS earlier in the week put the manufacturing sector's PMI at 50.8 and construction at 54.2."The weaker increase in services activity mainly reflected a slower expansion in the volume of incoming new business," the survey said.Markit chief economist Chris Williamson added: "Survey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of 'Brexit', financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad."He added that the extent of the slowdown would come as a "shock" to policymakers and would put an end to talk of a possible interest rate rise.Mr Williamson described February's three PMI readings as "a triple whammy of disappointing survey news".Last week, official figures confirmed that the UK economy grew 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, with the services sector highlighted as the key factor driving growth.The Office for National Statistics said the "buoyancy" of services had offset the "relative sluggishness" of the rest of the UK economy.Signs of weakening growth in the UK economy have pushed back estimates of when the Bank of England might begin to raise interest rates.Commenting on the latest PMI survey, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said: "The May Bank of England meeting had previously been seen as a possible time for a rate hike. The volatility of global markets and the self-inflicted wound of the EU referendum put paid to that months ago."We still believe, however, that some measures that foresee the Bank of England holding rates at 0.5% until 2020 are little short of absurd."Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the PMI readings would provide "plenty of food for thought" for the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee.He added: "Members will have to judge the degree to which the surveys are flagging a genuine slowdown in activity growth, or merely reacting to the negative headlines since the start of the year. In reality, growth may be softening, but perhaps not as sharply as the survey data suggest."Meanwhile, a similar survey indicated that eurozone businesses had their worst month for more than a year in February, bolstering the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank.Markit's final composite PMI, which is regarded as a good guide to growth, fell to 53 last month from January's 53.6 - its lowest reading since the start of 2015.However, that was better than the preliminary reading of 52.7 and well above the 50 mark that denotes growth.^The UK's dominant services sector weakened in February, registering its slowest rate of growth for nearly three years, a survey has indicated.
Sally Shalloe, 51, of Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, died when her bicycle was hit by David Staley's motorbike in Middleton Boulevard in April last year.At Nottingham Crown Court, Staley, 32, admitted causing Ms Shalloe's death by dangerous driving.Staley, of Arnold, Nottingham, is due to be sentenced on 13 May.Ms Shalloe worked as a research fellow at the University of Nottingham, and husband Jim Hill said his wife previously produced studies on road safety."She was cycling to work that morning," said Mr Hill, who had been married to Ms Shalloe for 16 years."I had a policewoman walk into my work office and tell me she'd been killed. It was like being split in two with an axe."It's turned my life upside down completely. I've got a constant feeling of loss."Staley was disqualified from the roads before being bailed ahead of his sentencing.^A motorcyclist has pleaded guilty to causing the death of a former road safety worker who was killed in a crash on a busy Nottingham road.
A software "issue" meant polling cards and some postal votes were sent out to some "non eligible" voters.They are still awaiting responses from six councils so the number could rise.Leave campaigners Iain Duncan Smith and Bernard Jenkin have expressed "serious concerns" about the "conduct of the EU referendum and its franchise".They have written to the prime minister complaining of "many and varied" examples of EU nationals being sent polling cards.On Friday, the Electoral Commission confirmed the numbers affected so far, and said the software provider had since "resolved the issue".Any postal votes wrongly issued would be cancelled and none of those affected would appear as an eligible voter on the electoral registers used at polling stations, it said.EU citizens from non-UK countries are not entitled to vote, unless they are citizens of the Irish Republic, Cyprus or Malta.But Mr Duncan Smith has said a Nottingham City Council officer had emailed a Vote Leave supporter to say the council was unable to check whether people put their correct nationality on an application, and had to assume the information submitted was correct.Kingston-upon-Thames council in south-west London said a Polish citizen in the area - whose case had been highlighted by the Guido Fawkes website - was sent a polling card because he had put "British" as his nationality on the electoral register.British, Irish and Commonwealth citizens resident in the UK and many British citizens living abroad are entitled to vote in the referendum.You can check with your local authority's electoral services team if you are worried that you are not on the register.If you are not on the register you have until midnight on Tuesday, 7 June to submit an application for a vote. The deadlines for applying for a postal vote at the referendum are:In England, Scotland or Wales, you can register to vote online anytime at gov.uk/register-to-vote. If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can register to vote online in the same way.In Northern Ireland, visit the government's Register to vote in Northern Ireland page to download a registration form. If you are an Irish citizen living abroad who was born in Northern Ireland, visit the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website to download the correct form.^Polling cards were wrongly sent to at least 3,462 EU citizens who are not allowed to vote in the EU referendum, the Electoral Commission has announced.
It is hoped the theatre, founded in 1875, will be used for theatrical performances, cinema screenings, comedy and live music.The BBC studios, at the eastern end of the Palace, will also be repaired and refurbished.If successful in raising funds it is hoped the theatre will reopen in 2018.The theatre and studios form part of a larger east wing restoration project to transform Alexandra Palace into a new cultural destination.As part of the renovations, the glazed east court will become a space for the public and for exhibitions.Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) is contributing £18.8m towards the project, while Haringey Council is contributing £6.8m.The entire east wing will be refurbished at a cost of £26.6m.Alexandra Park and Palace Charitable Trust have committed to raising the final £1m by summer 2017.The theatre, which has languished unused for decades, still has much of its original decor and stage machinery in place.It was created to showcase opera, musicals, plays and all kinds of entertainment, even hosting early cinema screenings.^Alexandra Palace has started a £1m fundraising campaign to bring its Victorian theatre back to life after lying unused for 80 years.
About 10 hotels, pubs and club houses were also closed, officials said.Some estimates put Lagos' population at around 20 million, creating a constant background of noise - from the blaring of car horns, to the Muslim call to prayer and loud singing in churches.The state government has vowed to make the city, the biggest in Africa, noise-free by 2020.Africa Live: More on this and other news storiesIn August, the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LEPA) closed 22 premises after residents complained about noise emanating from them.Following the latest crackdown, its general manager Bola Shabi said the agency would no longer allow people to pray in makeshift buildings and tents.Mr Shabi said noise levels had been reduced by about 35%, but this was not a "pass mark yet"."Enforcement is a continuous exercise and we have set a target for ourselves. We want to ensure that Lagos is noise-free by the year 2020," he said.Mr Shabi said mosques complied with their instructions more than churches because when they are ordered to shut down, they "instantly bring down their speakers or reduce the noise they make''.Nigerians are extremely religious, with a large number of evangelical churches operating in Lagos.Christians form the majority in the city.In 2014, 116 people died when a building owned by popular televangelist TB Joshua collapsed in Lagos.^Authorities in Nigeria's Lagos State have shut 70 churches and 20 mosques in an attempt to reduce high noise levels.
Harvey, 21, scored five goals in 50 league appearances for the Pilgrims but rejected the offer a new contract.Manager Gary Mills is also considering signing ex-Burton Albion striker Shaun Harrad, who has been training with the Dragons.Harrad is a free agent after finishing the 2015-16 season at Torquay, who are keen to re-sign the 31-year-old."He's experienced, knows the leagues and has scored an abundance of goals in his career," Mills told BBC Wales Sport."I managed him at Notts County when he was a younger player so he could well be part of us as well."Full-back Jordan Evans has also been on trial with the National League side following his release from Championship club Fulham.Evans is a product of Wrexham's academy and Mills said the 20-year-old could sign for the club ahead of their opening league game against Dover Athletic on 6 August.^Wrexham have signed Plymouth Argyle forward Tyler Harvey on a one-year deal.
Joseph Michael Schreiber faces at least 30 years in prison if convicted on charges of arson with a hate crime enhancement, said authorities.The suspect allegedly made multiple anti-Muslim posts on social media.The Islamic Center of Fort Pierce was heavily damaged in the fire, which was set on the anniversary of 9/11.Omar Mateen, who occasionally went to the mosque, shot dead 49 people in Pulse nightclub in June before being killed.He professed allegiance to the Islamic State group.On Wednesday evening, St Lucie County Sheriff's Office said Mr Schreiber owns a motorcycle consistent with one shown on surveillance video footage outside the mosque on the night of the fire."Other evidence collected also linked Schreiber to the arson," Maj David Thompson told a news conference.Schreiber has made a number of comments against Islam on what appears to be his Facebook page.One post said: "ALL ISLAM IS RADICAL , and should be considered TERRORIST AND CRIMANALS and all hoo participate in such activity should be found guilty of WAR CRIM".Mr Schreiber was previously sentenced twice to state prison for theft, according to the Florida Department of Corrections records.He served his first term from 2008-09 and his second stretch from 2010-14.No one was injured in the weekend's blaze, which coincided with the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.The FBI and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined the investigation.The blaze has left the mosque's members "saddened and scared", said assistant imam Hamaad Rahman.In addition to Mateen, the mosque was also visited by Moner Mohammad Abu Salha, who became the first American to commit a suicide bombing attack in Syria.^A 32-year-old man has been arrested over last Sunday's fire attack on a Florida mosque, which was attended by the Orlando nightclub gunman.
Announcing the "digital-only" move, ESI Media said "some redundancies among editorial employees" would be made.But it said there would also be 25 new "digital-content roles".ESI has also confirmed it will sell its sister title, i newspaper, to Johnston Press, for an expected Â£24m, subject to approval from Johnston's shareholders.Evgeny Lebedev, ESI's owner, said: "This decision preserves the Independent brand and allows us to continue to invest in the high-quality editorial content that is attracting more and more readers to our online platforms."The last print edition of the Independent will be published on Saturday 26 March, while the last Independent on Sunday will be on 20 March.By BBC media correspondent David SillitoIt's easy to forget how groundbreaking the Independent was when it launched. It looked strikingly modern, it came with none of the partisan baggage of 1980s politics and in an era of bitter industrial disputes that blighted rivals such as the Times, it carved out a large readership.At its peak sales hit around 428,000 copies a day. Twenty-five years later, the number of copies being sold on a weekday in newsagents is rather closer to 28,000.This is an announcement that has been long awaited. The problem about switching to digital is that the big British print newspapers bring in revenues in hundreds of millions of pounds while even the best digital products make only tens of millions.The long decline in print readership has led to many declarations that print will be dead in a few years' time, but until a way is found to make more money out of digital, they will hang on to their print readers to the very end.ESI said the number of staff affected would be "confirmed following a consultation period".It said a "significant number" of staff would move to Johnston Press, which also own the Scotsman, the Yorkshire Post and some 250 other local and regional newspapers, as part of the sale of the i newspaper.The closure of the Independent's print editions will have "no bearing on the status" of the London Evening Standard - also owned by ESI - the company added.The Independent's editor Amol Rajan tweeted: "Impossible to over-state how proud I am of the most dedicated, clever, industrious and brave staff in the history of Fleet St."The Independent was set up in 1986, and at its peak had a circulation of more than 400,000 copies, but December's figures showed it lagging far behind rival national newspapers.Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev took control of the loss-making newspapers in 2010 when he bought Independent News for Media for Â£1.In 2014, his son Evgeny told the BBC the Independent could be sold if someone "offers the right price" - but he was "not actively trying to sell it".The first front page of the Independent was written by Mark Urban, now BBC Newsnight's diplomatic correspondent, a 25-year-old "young stripling"."I went there because I was inspired", he said. "Their mission was to be the best. I thought it was a noble mission, and even if it all goes horribly wrong, it's worth a try."Many experienced journalists were among those who risked their careers and turned up "with typewriters" to launch the title, he said."For four weeks before launch dates, there were dummy runs every day. There was a very strong sense of purpose."Journalists from other publications and broadcasters paid tribute to the title and its staff.ITV political editor Robert Peston tweeted: "Closure of @Independent as print title is heart-rending, terrible. Such an important paper in its day."The BBC's Andrew Marr, a former editor of the Independent, replied: "Not in its day, Robert. Its day is now!"Editor of the Independent on Sunday Lisa Markwell tweeted some of the paper's most memorable front pages, adding: "My proudest professional achievement has been to preside over the brilliant, brave @IndyOnSunday team for 3 years."Stephen Glover, a co-founder of the Independent, said the paper was selling "so few copies that it doesn't really make sense to go on printing it every day".Speaking on Thursday - before the move was confirmed - he told BBC Newsnight: "If it is true then I think it will be the first of many papers which stop their print editions and have another existence online."He said the Financial Times and the Guardian could also stop producing print editions "within the next few years", and in 10 to 15 years there would not be "very many" printed newspapers.Mr Glover said there was a "longer question" about whether online-only papers could support the same number of journalists and do the "same sort of journalism" as printed ones.The Times' media editor Beth Rigby said the industry had been in turmoil for many years, "and now we're beginning to see the hard end of that", adding that the Guardian and Telegraph were also facing major changes.Writing in the Guardian's website, professor of journalism Brian Cathcart predicted that all UK national newspapers would eventually go out of print.He added: "No-one can say in what order it will happen, but it will happen to the most venerable titles, even to the top-selling Sun and Mail."^The Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers are to cease print editions in March, leaving only an online edition, the owner has said.
It is not binding on the government, which said it would be a mistake to give guarantees to EU nationals in the UK without similar concessions for UK nationals living elsewhere in the EU.How do the numbers compare?The UK has a population of 63.7 million, of which 5.3 million (8%) are non-British, and just over half of those - 2.9 million (5%) - are from Europe.Just under 1.2 million UK nationals live elsewhere in the EU.Of the non-British population from EU countries, the largest group was Polish nationals, with about 853,000, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) Population of the United Kingdom by Country of Birth and Nationality report.The Irish were the second-largest group, with 331,000 residing here. Romanian and Portuguese nationals are in joint third place, with 175,000 people from each country living in Britain.These figures include only those living in the UK for at least a year.Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo has already said that the country would work in negotiations to "ensure that Poles living in Great Britain retain their privileges".The Irish government has also announced its contingency plans now that the UK has voted to leave the EU, including making preparations for increased numbers of UK citizens applying for Irish passports.Of those 2.9 million EU nationals living in the UK, about 2.15 million are working.Five years ago that figure was 1.33 million and 10 years ago it was 758,000.There are about 1.19 million non-UK nationals from outside the EU working in the UK.The figure of just under 1.2 million UK nationals living in the rest of the EU comes from the United Nations.These are the best statistics available, although they are not perfect, with some countries counting international migrants by birthplace while others judge by the passport someone holds.Of the 27 EU countries, Spain had the most UK nationals with just under 310,000 migrants from the UK living there in 2015. Ireland was second with 255,000 and France third with 185,000.Of those UK nationals in Spain, 106,610 were claiming the UK state pension, according to figures from the Department for Work and Pensions, while 133,250 pensioners were living in the Republic of Ireland.Read more: The facts behind claims about our relationship with the EU^On 6 July, a motion in the House of Commons calling on the government to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK was passed by 245 votes to two.

The venomous green-and-yellow snake has been missing since Wednesday, its owner told the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.The owner is an "experienced snake handler" and has a permit to have the snake as a pet, said the commission's spokesman Greg Workman.Local residents are warned not to get close to the snake.The owner, Mike Kennedy, is an exotic animal dealer and star of the Discovery Channel reality show Airplane Repo.He could face criminal charges for not alerting authorities about the escape immediately.Officials are scanning the area surrounding the home in the search for the reptile, which is not native to Florida."Most likely no one is going to see it," Florida Fish and Wildlife captain Chris Roszkowiak said. "We believe it's going to stay on the property here."His group is asking people to call an alert hotline if they spot the snake, but the escape has neighbours on edge."I'm going to go load my guns. Well, they're already loaded, but I'm going to have them ready for sure. I mean, that thing's big enough to take you down for sure," James McLeod told WESH, a local TV station.^Florida wildlife officials are hunting for an 8-foot-long (2.4m) king cobra snake escaped from an Orlando home.
Fabian Picardo, the territory's chief minister, told the BBC he was speaking to Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, about various options.One possibility under discussion is for Gibraltar and Scotland, which both voted to remain in the EU, to maintain the UK's membership of the bloc.Ms Sturgeon confirmed to the BBC that talks are under way with Gibraltar.Northern Ireland could also potentially be included in the discussions."I can imagine a situation where some parts of what is today the member state United Kingdom are stripped out and others remain," Mr Picardo told Newsnight."That means that we don't have to apply again for access, we simply remain with the access we have today, and those parts that leave are then given a different sort of access, which is negotiated but not necessarily under Article 50," he said, referring to a provision in the Lisbon Treaty that sets out how a member state can voluntarily leave the Union.There is a precedent for such a proposal. Denmark joined what was then the EEC in 1973, the same year as the UK and Ireland.Greenland gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979 and seceded from the EU in 1985, following a referendum three years earlier.Nicola Sturgeon has previously said that a second referendum on independence for Scotland is "highly likely", following last Thursday's Leave victory.More than 95% of Gibraltarians voted for Remain on Thursday. The vast majority also want to remain in the UK.The territory overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to share sovereignty with Spain in a referendum in 2002. Mr Picardo insisted Gibraltar's status as a British Overseas Territory should not mean giving up its membership of the EU."The position of the people of Gibraltar is that we've expressed, perhaps even more clearly than the Scots, what our view is going forward, what should happen - that we should continue to have access to the single market to the European Union. My obligation is to protect and promote the interests of Gibraltar and to find such partners who may be willing to do the same thing within the United Kingdom."Following the referendum last week, Spain again raised the issue of joint sovereignty of Gibraltar."The Spanish flag on the Rock is much closer than before," Spain's acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said on Friday.But speaking in his first broadcast interview since the referendum on Thursday, Fabian Picardo said any claims by Spain to the territory would be dismissed out of hand."Anybody who thinks that this is a time to propose joint sovereignty or that they're going to get any millimetre of advantage in respect of the sovereignty of Gibraltar is completely wrong. They shouldn't waste their breath, they shouldn't waste their time, they shouldn't waste the time of the European people as we try to navigate this issue that has been presented to us on Friday morning."Gabriel Gatehouse is in Gibraltar for BBC Newsnight. Watch his report on the programme at 22:30 BST on BBC Two.^Gibraltar is in talks with Scotland about a plan to keep parts of the UK in the EU, BBC Newsnight has learned.
Lisa Passey, 28, and her former partner Wayne Dale, 45, left Kian and another two-year-old child alone while the pair entertained a friend.Giving evidence at Worcester Crown Court, Ms Passey said it "was down to me and Wayne.. it's our fault".Both deny gross negligence manslaughter.More updates on this and other stories in Hereford and WorcesterBreaking down at times while recounting what happened the day Kian died at the couple's home in Kyreside, Tenbury Wells, Ms Passey said: "I don't want any pity. I was stupid for not going upstairs."While Kian was in the bath, the court has heard, Ms Passey was in her garden with a friend drinking coffee and smoking.Mr Dale joined them to also smoke and then "burn" a CD for the friend.Kian was later discovered motionless in an overflowing bath by Mr Dale. His death was consistent with drowning, including what was believed to be soap bubbles in his lungs.It was suggested to the court that the two-year-old had turned the taps on while the pair were downstairs.Ms Passey was questioned about giving differing accounts of what happened to doctors, police and social services, including telling a doctor the children had been in a dry, empty bath."I was all over the place," she told prosecution barrister, Jonas Hankin QC."If you'd gone through it yourself, losing a child, you'd realise you're still trying to grieve,"She told the court it was a regular occurrence for Mr Dale to leave Kian in the bath, but only "for a few minutes".The trial continues.^The mother of a 13-month-old boy who drowned in a bath has told jurors she was "stupid" to leave him unsupervised for 15 minutes.
He said Mrs May must remember she is the PM of all parts of the UK.Lord Alderdice was speaking in the House of Lords as peers considered the government's Brexit bill.He was speaking in support of an amendment that insists that no hard border is put in place between NI and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.The amendment proposed by former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain stated that an open border must continue in line with the provisions of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.After hearing government assurances during the debate, Lord Hain later withdrew his amendment.Lord Hain, who was Northern Ireland secretary of state from 2005 until 2007, said: "If we get this wrong, for the UK, it may be perilous. For Northern Ireland it could be politically lethal."Lord Alderdice, a Liberal Democrat peer who voted Remain in last year's referendum, said that Mrs May must not view the issue of the border as if she was still home secretary.He added that it was his fear that the government was looking at this with "the approach of the Home Office".He also called on Mrs May to approach the issue of the border with "imagination" and "political creativity".In response, Lord Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader who sits on the Conservative benches, rejected the amendment supported by Lord Alderdice and Lord Hain.Lord Trimble told peers he did not believe the amendment was necessary.He said: "The amendment is asking the Prime Minster to support the maintenance of the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland."The Prime Minister does that as of now. It is in the White Paper. It is not necessary."Former Conservative minister, Lord Howell, supported Lord Trimble's position on the amendment.Former UUP leader, Lord Empey, said the amendment was "misplaced".He told his fellow peers that he agreed totally with "an open free border".However, he called on the government to give an assurance that "there will be no internal border in the UK".Baroness O'Loan told a packed chamber that she opposed the amendment.She said it would not "benefit the UK" and that the issue of the border should be "dealt with in the negotiations".Lord Kilclooney, the former Ulster Unionist MP, also opposed the amendment and told the house that the "southern Irish were petrified about Brexit".Earlier, Lord Hain said Brexit could cause "profound damage" to the peace process and warned that a return to checkpoints along the border would sew division and discontent.Responding for the government, Lord Dunlop said there was no need for Lord Hain's amendment.He said the "government's intentions are clear" and that no undertaking was "necessary".The peer, who represents the Northern Ireland Office, added that maintaining the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland "will be a priority".He said the government is seeking "practical solutions" to achieve as "frictionless a border as possible".At the end of the debate, Lord Hain withdrew his amendment.His move came as peers began the detailed committee stage debate on the European Union Notification of Withdrawal Bill.The legislation has already cleared the Commons without amendment.^The former Alliance leader Lord Alderdice has said Theresa May must not view herself as being "Prime Minister of England and a few add on bits".
The left-back was expected to miss Saturday's defeat by Aberdeen while he sought the advice of a specialist to help with a hip complaint.But Clark was impressed as the former Rangers defender declared himself fit."He has shown the courage that he wants to play through the little injury problem he has," said Clark."He didn't look like he had any injury on Saturday."Smith could not prevent Kilmarnock losing 2-1 to the side sitting second top of the table and falling five points behind Hamilton Academical in their battle to escape the play-off place.However, Clark said of his captain: "I saw him bombing down the line in the 94th minute to try and put a cross in as we chased an equaliser."So I was really happy he was back in the team."It's no co-incidence we looked a stronger team when Stevie was back in."He's a good example to everyone else in the squad that, as captain, he's willing to put himself forward when not 100% fit and roll his sleeves up. That's brilliant for me."However, Clark insisted that he would not want Smith to do anything that would cause problems with his career."I'm not a manager who wants to put somebody in jeopardy by making an injury worse, but it's great to see him putting his body on the line to help the club," he added."We are hoping to manage him through until the end of the season."Ultimately, it will be down to Steve whether that proves too difficult."Some sessions he might just work with the physio, but he's an experienced player, he's got good fitness levels and knows his body, so we're prepared to work with him to get him out on the park on a match day, because having him there will be crucial for us."^Manager Lee Clark has praised captain Stevie Smith for playing through an injury in an attempt to steer Kilmarnock clear of relegation.
Official numbers showed revenues down 32.2% for the period to 16.4bn Macau patacas ($2.05bn; Â£1.36bn).Expectations were for a fall in revenues of just over 31%.Macau is the world's largest gaming centre - ahead of Las Vegas - and the only place in China where casinos are allowed.A special administrative region of China, Macau's economy relies heavily on gambling and shopping - especially by big spending tourists from the mainland.But Chinese President Xi Jinping's campaign against corruption and luxury spending, which began in December 2012, has seen officials and others from the mainland more wary of gaming and spending in the city.China's Communist Party prohibits officials from gambling, but until the 2012 crackdown, officials had reportedly visited Macau's casinos to gamble and spend.China has emphasised Macau's need to diversify its economy away from gambling. The city's build up of new resorts and hotels is expected to help drive general tourism, however, analysts have said Macau will be hard-pressed to build up non-gaming streams of revenue in the near future.Official numbers released on Monday showed the city's economy shrank by 24.2% year-on-year during three months to September, the city's Statistics and Census Service said."Economic contraction in the third quarter was attributable to the continuous decline in exports of services, of which exports of gaming services decreased by 37.4% year-on-year and exports of other tourism services dropped by 15.3%," it added.Once a Portuguese colony, gaming has taken place in Macau for more than 300 years. For many years it was referred to as the Monte Carlo of the Orient. The city was returned to Chinese rule in 1999.^Revenue in Macau's casinos fell by more than a third in November from a year earlier as China's corruption crackdown continued to drive away some punters.
We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia.What we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin.We travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages.What we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people.We met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast.Let's call him Kamrul Rahman.He appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up.As the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked.He said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them.It seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost.He said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about Â£1,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand.I was amazed. "So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?" I asked."Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger", he told me, without any sign of emotion."If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour."We spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh.They all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made.What this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party.The so-called "ransoms" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey.Take a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys.They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp.Stina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into.If you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers.The migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like.Meanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid.The model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier.It seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand.But other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty.We were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (Â£260/$400) back to his family each month.But many, many migrants don't make it.Within minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters).Some said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family.According to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia.Many die before they even reach the camps, he told me."Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food."All people have to die", he said, "that is fate."^Over the last couple of weeks, the world has woken up to the horrific trade in human beings being conducted in the seas of South East Asia.
It involves candidates hoping to become the world's most prominent diplomat.At the stroke of midnight on 31 December, as the glitter ball in Times Square makes its annual descent, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is due to end his term in office.The manoeuvring to succeed him - at present it is too genteel to describe it as a fight - is now moving into higher gear.Just as Campaign 2016 could end up with the election of the first female US president, there's a strong possibility that the next head of the UN will become the organisation's first female secretary-general.This week, for the first time in the 70-year history of the UN, the declared candidates will take part in public hustings.This is a radical departure for an organisation that rivals the Vatican in the shadowy secrecy of its executive recruitment process, with its monochrome backrooms hosting the UN equivalent of the papal conclave in the Sistine Chapel.Those who have so far put their names forward, half of them women, will face two hours of questioning from member states.To support their applications, they've also been asked to post their curricula vitae online and to compose a 2,000-word vision statement articulating how they would run an organisation with 30 separate agencies, funds and programmes and 40,000 staff, not to mention 193 member states.What has long been a ridiculously closeted and opaque process is being made more inclusive and transparent. The aim is to turn it into something bearing at least some resemblance to a regular interview process, a far cry from the stealth selection procedure that produced Mr Ban.When the South Korean was jockeying for the job, he shied away from campaigning inside the UN headquarters he would soon end up running.Eight candidates have so far declared and most are from Eastern Europe. Under an unwritten rule of regional rotation, a diplomatic version of "Buggins' turn", this geographical bloc is next in line to fill the vacancy.To a global audience, most of the candidates are "need-to-Google" figures.Top row (from left):Bottom row (from left):More information on the candidates and the selection procedure is available on the UN's websiteThe field is expected to grow. Kristalina Georgieva, a Bulgarian who is a vice-president of the European Commission, might yet be persuaded to run and may well be Mr Ban's preferred choice.In a move that boosted her UN profile, he selected the former World Bank official to co-chair a panel looking into the funding of humanitarian aid.However, the Bulgarian government is backing Ms Bokova, who heads the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), and Ms Georgieva herself has indicated that she intends to pay "full attention" for the time being to her EU responsibilities.Kevin Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, has long made the UN secretary-general's job the target of his immense personal ambition.Then there is the wild card. Many diplomats would like to see German Chancellor Angela Merkel throw her giant-sized hat in the ring.More of a general than a secretary, Mrs Merkel is precisely the kind of big hitter that many UN watchers believe the organisation desperately needs after the more timid leadership style of Mr Ban.For all the attempts to modernise the process it could never be described as democratic. Nowhere near.Under the selection procedure, the 15-member Security Council recommends a single candidate for the 193-member General Assembly to essentially rubber stamp.Thus, the power still resides with the permanent five members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia, the UK and US - which can all veto candidates. The US, for instance, vetoed Boutros Boutros-Ghali, when the Egyptian sought a second five-year term.Though the hustings may be held in public, the next UN secretary-general will be the candidate who emerges from backroom bargaining, mainly involving the US and Russia.What's more important than the candidates' CVs, then, is whether at any stage of their careers they have displeased the permanent "P5" members.This is a headache for Ms Bokova, who as head of Unesco, admitted the Palestinians into the organisation, against the express wishes of the US, which retaliated by cutting off funding.She is also seen as Moscow's preferred choice, which means the US is almost certain to block her. As for her fellow Bulgarian, Ms Georgieva could pay a price for the EU's sanctions against Russia. Others fail what's been called the "testicular test".Despite the new-found openness of the process, UN reformers had been lobbying for more sweeping changes to the selection process.The 1 for 7 Billion campaign, an umbrella group bringing together NGOs from all over the world, has urged the Security Council to recommend two candidates to the General Assembly, something the P5 veto-wielders would never sanction.They would also prefer to see the new secretary-general appointed to a single seven-year term, rather than the present practice of serving two five-year terms. Again, that will not happen.So despite calls for a strong figurehead for the UN - that general rather than secretary idea - the present system means that compromise candidates inevitably emerge, who are not necessarily the most able but the least objectionable to the P5 countries.Rather than a big name, the UN could easily end up with a leader little known outside diplomatic circles, a new secretary-general whom most of the world will have to Google.^As the hoopla of the presidential campaign comes to New York, featuring the political all-stars seeking to become the world's most powerful leader, another race is also under way in the city - a contest of the largely obscure.
Seal wardens on the National Trust (NT) reserve at Blakeney Point have recorded 180 more grey seal pups compared to this time last year.Coastal ranger Ajay Tegala said the location is a "fantastic" breeding site as "human disturbance is minimal."Mr Tegala predicts up to 1,800 pups could be born by the end of February."The seals like Blakeney Point as it has beaches and dunes which are safe and easy places to have a pup with no predators," he said.Last year, 1,566 pups were counted during the four month breeding season at Blakeney Point, a split of shingle and sand jutting out into the North Sea.Seals have been breeding on the site since about 2001, when just 25 were recorded.Pup numbers reached over 1,000 for the first time during the 2012-13 breeding season, with newborns now increasing by about 25% year-on-year.Blakeney has become well known for its seals with thousands of tourist taking boat trips to see the colonies each year.Mr Tegala said: "We do a pup count twice a week and comparing this year to last year we're almost 200 ahead so it looks like the number will continue to increase and another record-breaking year is on the cards."Source: BBC NatureVisitors have been flocking to the north Norfolk coast to see the seals, prompting the NT to warn people to keep their distance and keep all dogs on leads.^More than 900 seal pups have been born on a north Norfolk nature reserve in the last three weeks giving experts hopes of another record breaking year.
Two gay couples denied licenses have requested Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis be held in contempt of court.But they asked a district judge to punish Ms Davis by fining her, rather than sending her to jail.The US Supreme Court on Monday rejected the argument that her faith prevented her from carrying out her duty.Despite court orders to continue issuing licences, Ms Davis turned away two gay couples seeking marriage licences on Tuesday morning.Ms Davis, who cannot be removed from post because she is an elected official, stayed inside her office with the blinds closed as the couples demanded to see her.She eventually came out, but she said she would not issue any licences."Under whose authority?" she was asked. "Under God's authority," she said.Dozens of reporters and activists, both supporters and opponents of gay marriage, filled the waiting area of the Rowan County clerk's office, alternatively chanting "do your job" and "stand firm".One of the men seeking a licence, David Ermold, said he and his partner would not leave the office until they were married."Then you're going to have a long day," Ms Davis replied.Since the court legalised gay marriage nationwide two months ago, Ms Davis has refused to issue any marriage licences to anyone.The American Civil Liberties Union sued her on behalf of two gay couples and two heterosexual couples.The clerk has been ordered to appear in federal court on Thursday to address a motion filed by one of the couples asking for her to be held in contempt of court.In making its ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court denied her request for a stay while she pursues an appeal.^A Christian official has refused to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples in Kentucky despite exhausting all of her legal options.
It is thought to be the second test of the North's new Musudan missile. An attempt earlier this month also failed.The tests come amid a recent ramp-up in weapons activity as the country prepares for a rare party congress.Reports suggest it is planning a fifth nuclear test, despite condemnation of its last test in January.South Korean officials said the mid-range missile launch took place early Thursday morning near the eastern coastal city of Wonsan but the missile "crashed a few seconds later" in the coastal area, reported Yonhap news agency.The incident was captured by a US surveillance satellite.The Musudan missiles are said to be able to travel up to 4,000km (2,485 miles), within the range of US territories in the Pacific.No confirmation of the attempt or the failure has come from North Korea, but sources in South Korea say that the movement of two so-called Musudan missiles, mounted on trucks, was detected earlier in the month.One was launched two weeks ago and tracked but failed to go far. The same has now happened to the second, according to South Korea.Kim Jong-un is building up to a big event in just over a week, a rare meeting of the ruling Workers' Party in Pyongyang.He has trumpeted a series of announcements about progress towards having a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking Washington. Failed launches indicate that the reality may not match the rhetoric.All the same, they indicate determination. A fifth nuclear test coinciding with the congress would not be a surprise.On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-su suggested that it would suspend nuclear tests if the US ended its annual military exercises with the South.But US President Barack Obama dismissed the proposal, saying it was not serious and that North Korea would "have to do better than that".Strengthened international sanctions were placed on North Korea after it tested what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb and launched a long-range missile.Over the weekend it also claimed it fired a submarine ballistic missile.Observers have speculated that Pyongyang is boosting the development of its weapons programs ahead of its political conference aimed at solidifying the power of its leader Kim Jong-un.The North announced this week that the congress, which was last held in 1980, would take place on 6 May.^North Korea has test fired a mid-range ballistic missile which crashed a few seconds after launch, say South Korean military officials.

The video for You're In Love With A Psycho sees band members dancing around a mental institution with presenter Noel Fielding and Taboo actor Stephen Graham.Mental health campaigners Time to Change said the video played into a "sad and tired" stereotype.The BBC has contacted Kasabian for a response.The video sees the celebrity stars and Kasabian band members wearing flesh-coloured hospital gowns and taking medication before gathering their fellow residents for an aerobics-inspired dance routine.Time to Change, a movement trying to change public attitude towards people with mental health problems, said the video - combined with the use of the word psycho - was "unhelpful".Singer Tom Meighan has previously talked about his own mental health. In an interview with Q magazine, he discussed the impact of a friend's death and how he made himself ill.Director of Time to Change, Sue Baker, said: "As so many musicians have recently talked openly about their experiences of mental health problems it is disappointing to see this video."The use of the word 'psycho' in a song and accompanying music video featuring people pretending to be psychiatric inpatients is unhelpful, damaging and disappointing when society is moving on from this sad and tired stereotype."She said while the harm may have been "unintentional, or misjudged irony", the video will "only serve to fuel stigma".Ms Baker added: "If fans think it is OK to call people with mental health problems who have been psychiatric inpatients 'psychos', then we are turning back the tide of progress on public attitudes that are more respectful and less judgemental of people living with mental health problems."We are keen to work with the band and the music industry to help shift outdated stereotypes and stigma."You're In Love With A Psycho is the first single from Kasabian's forthcoming sixth album, For Crying Out Loud.^Kasabian's latest music video has been called "damaging" by a mental health organisation.
The women, aged between 18 and 29, have been recruited on social media.Five of them are now living with IS militants in the conflict zones, according to a special investigation by Victoria Police.Concern has been rising since mid-2014 about Australians going to the Middle East to fight for IS.The government will soon introduce legislation allowing it to strip dual citizens fighting in Iraq or Syria of their Australian citizenship.People working in Australia to support militant groups will also be targeted by the changes.Task Force Pax was established in April to monitor Victorians believed to be involved with insurgents.Officials from the task force told local media on Friday that another four Melbourne women made it as far as Turkey before being turned back by authorities.One other was stopped by customs officers in Australia while two remain unaccounted for.The young women are all from Melbourne's northern and south-eastern suburbs.Assistant Commissioner Tracy Linford said two forensic psychologists had been embedded in the task force to help investigators understand why the young women were trying to join IS."The use of psychologists provides us with a far more comprehensive risk assessment and also assists in identifying early intervention opportunities," she said."This gives us the chance to focus on identifying those youths most at risk of radicalisation and to engage with them or their families directly."Local media reported that one of the women was 21-year-old Zehra Duman, who allegedly travelled overseas in December to join Mahmoud Abullatif, a Melbourne man believed to be a Islamic extremist.She travelled to Syria without her parent's knowledge, The Age newspaper reported.It is believed Abullatif was killed while fighting with IS in January but Ms Duman has yet to return home.Police said the young women were being sold a romantic view of life with IS, and had lied to their families about their travel plans.Authorities were warning parents and friends of young women about the lure of IS, saying the women could end up in arranged marriages, or forced into sexual servitude in the Middle East."Our intelligence tells us these women are going over there to meet their partners, to marry somebody in an arranged marriage or be pushed into sexual servitude," Assistant Commissioner Linford told reporters.The Herald Sun newspaper said mother Dullel Kassab was another of the women identified by police.The Australian government believes at least 100 Australians are fighting with militant groups in the Middle East.Another 150 people in Australia are known to be supporting such groups, while Australia's intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), is investigating about 400 high-priority terrorist cases.^As many as 12 young women have tried to leave Melbourne to join the Islamic State (IS) militant group, according to Australian police.
Ivan Cameron, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in hospital aged six in February 2009.Mrs Cameron told the Times: "Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant."She also said it changed her husband's outlook. "I think it changed Dave's politics. It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective."David Cameron had been an MP for less than a year when Ivan was born in 2002, and became prime minister the year after Ivan died.Mrs Cameron said: "From the moment he is born, you are living in a situation that is quite surreal and difficult to deal with."It is intense every day, in and out of hospitals... in a way, that prepared me for Dave being prime minister, because I was used to living and operating in a way that's not normal."When Ivan died, she said, the outside world "became meaningless"."Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice."The Camerons have three other children; Nancy, born in 2004; Arthur, born in 2006; and Florence, born in 2010.Mrs Cameron also spoke about her family's life in Downing Street."We tried to make the flat feel like a home."Dave would be combing the children's hair for nits before giving a speech in the evening."They got their groceries delivered because there was no supermarket nearby - and if she forgot butter, she would have to go to a shop in Trafalgar Square."So I did plan quite carefully."She also said she dreaded the official holiday photograph."At the last minute we would panic and think, 'Oh God, it's the holiday photo..."I hated the holding-hands thing because it looked too romantic, so we overdid the cups-of-coffee-looking-wistful pose."Mrs Cameron was speaking to the Times Magazine to promote her clothing brand Cefinn.Before her husband became Prime Minister, she was creative director for Smythson, which makes luxury leather goods.^Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former Prime Minister, has said their son's death "overshadowed everything".
Both missiles hit the water before reaching the USS Mason, a guided-missile destroyer.A spokesman for Yemen's rebel Houthi movement told the Saba news agency that it had not targeted any warships.The incident came eight days after an attack on an Emirati civilian ship that was also blamed on the Houthis.The UAE government said the high-speed catamaran was carrying aid, wounded Yemenis and passengers when it was hit in the Bab al-Mandab strait.US Naval Forces Central Command spokeswoman Paula Dunn said in a statement on Monday that the USS Mason had been "conducting routine operations in international waters" north of the strait when it "detected two inbound missiles" around 19:00 (16:00 GMT) on Sunday."Both missiles impacted the water before reaching the ship," Ms Dunn said, adding that "there were no injuries to our sailors and no damage to the ship"."We assess these missiles were launched from Houthi-controlled territory."However, a Houthi military spokesman told Saba that the charge was "baseless and aimed to cover for the heinous Saudi crime of Saturday's air attacks on the civilian funeral hall in the capital Sanaa", which killed more than 140 people.A Saudi-led multinational coalition, whose air campaign against the Houthis and their allies is supported by the US, has denied any responsibility.Also on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis at the King Fahd Air Base in Taif in central Saudi Arabia, which hosts US military personnel training the kingdom's armed forces.A missile was also reportedly fired at the Yemeni government-controlled city of Marib in central Yemen.The UN says at least 4,125 civilians have been killed and 7,207 injured since the coalition intervened in the conflict between forces loyal to Yemen's internationally-recognised government and those allied to the Houthis in March 2015.^Two missiles were fired at a US warship from rebel-held territory in Yemen as it passed through the Red Sea on Sunday, the US Navy has said.
Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane.About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's roster of 3,500 possible trips.The firm's boss, Justin Francis, took the decision after watching a BBC TV programme "Should we close our zoos?""Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant," he told the BBC."They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up."Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity.Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK.The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad.It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago.It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species.Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays.Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer.The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation."[Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments," said the president of Born Free, Will Travers."A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide," he added.Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision."They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree", he said.^A leading marketer of "responsible tourism" has decided to stop selling tours that include visits to zoos.
In 2013 a working group, set up by the Scottish government, recommended eligible couples should be offered up to three treatments.But that would only be after health boards had reduced IVF waiting times.Infertility Network UK said it was a "no-brainer" there should now be three cycles as waiting times have fallen.New IVF criteria was introduced in July 2013, following recommendations by the National Infertility Working Group.The changes were designed to standardise fertility treatment across Scotland to prevent a "postcode lottery".Giving evidence to Holyrood's health committee, the charity's chief executive Susan Seenan said: "The group recommended three cycles and said that once the waiting times were down to below 12 months, at the latest early 2015, they would consider moving to three cycles."It just doesn't seem to be happening as fast as we would like it to."We just think now that the waiting times are down, that it is a no-brainer - we should move to offering everybody who is eligible three cycles."Susan Seenan added: "Everybody in the group was agreed that...three cycles was the best possible way to move forward for patients."Why anybody would not want to move forward with that, I have no idea, unless it is finance related."A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said Scotland was "leading the way" in the provision of NHS IVF treatment, with Â£12m of investment over the last three years.She said the number of IVF cycles that couples were entitled to was under review.The spokeswoman added: "The reconvened expert group has met twice and its review will consider a range of issues, including the number of IVF cycles, to ensure access to IVF treatments remains fair, reliable and timely."The views of patients and our stakeholders, including Infertility Network Scotland who are part of the Infertility Group, will be instrumental to this process, along with data collection and modelling."Fertility treatment is currently available to those under 40, and is not offered to women who are obese.In addition, couples need to have been in a stable relationship for two years and neither partner can smoke for three months before treatment begins.Both partners also need to be methadone-free for a year before IVF starts.Women aged between 40 and 42 are eligible for one cycle of fertility treatment if they have never previously undergone the procedure.^A charity is calling for couples in Scotland who need help conceiving to have access to three cycles of IVF instead of two.

His first spell with the Potters lasted just under three years and, almost 12 months after he was initially sacked, he was re-appointed as manager and remained at the club for a further seven years.Within two years of his return, he guided Stoke to the top flight after a 23-year absence, took them to the 2011 FA Cup final and led them into Europe, before then suffering some criticism from supporters towards the end of his tenure.March 2003 - March 2004, March 2011 - April 2011, April 2012 - June 2012, March 2014 - presentBarnet can not get enough of Martin Allen, or Martin Allen can not get enough of Barnet? Either way, the man nicknamed "Mad Dog" has had an on-again-off-again relationship with the Bees for more than 16 years.He started his managerial career with the London side in the Conference in 2003, but did not see out an entire season before leaving for Brentford.Like a boomerang, however, he went back. Three times since, to be exact.The second stint was on an eight-match contract, of which he stayed around for three. Third time around, he helped save them from League Two relegation in another short-term stay, before making his latest comeback, helping them win promotion back to the EFL in 2015.February 1992 - January 1997, January 2008 - September 2008Kevin Keegan's management career both started and ended at Newcastle United, with stints as England, Fulham and Manchester City boss wedged in between.He was first given the Newcastle job in 1992, going on to save them from relegation, guide them to promotion to the Premier League, very nearly win the title and then take the club into the Champions League.Thousands of fans went to St James' Park to welcome him back as boss in January 2008, but he lasted only eight months and some 200 angry fans soon gathered outside the club's ground after hearing of his departure, with some even seen scaling the walls attempting to get in.March 1982 - June 1985, March 2006 - November 2007If this was a contest for the most regrettable return to a football club, then Jim Smith is the winner.In his first spell he took Oxford United to the top flight as Division Two champions in 1985. He then left for QPR after winning promotion, but returned two decades later to oversee their relegation from the Football League.Bristol Rovers: July 1987 - May 1991, June 2001 - December 2001; QPR: June 1991- November 1994, October 1998 - February 2001Former England midfielder Gerry Francis endeared himself to the Bristol Rovers faithful by leading them to the second tier as Division Three champions in 1990, pipping local rivals Bristol City to the title in the process.But, following a hugely popular return to manage the Pirates for a second time in 2001, he struggled to repeat anything like that success and quit before Christmas.Sandwiched in between were two spells in charge at QPR, the club for whom he made his name as a player, first in the Premier League and then in Division One.January 2009 - January 2011, October 2012 - presentEddie Howe, who had two permanent spells as a player at Bournemouth, has overseen the club's remarkable transformation from administration-hit League Two strugglers into Premier League survivors.After a spell as caretaker boss, Howe was appointed permanently in January 2009, going on to steer the Cherries to Football League safety and promotion from League Two.And, after a brief stint with Burnley, he returned in October 2012 to complete the job he started, guiding Bournemouth up to the Championship in April 2013 and then to the top flight for the first time in their history two years later.November 1969 - October 1975, October 1978 - July 1982, May 1985 - May 1987Serve the club three times as boss, guide them up every step of the Football League to the top flight and even work as general manager for a while. Your reward? Legendary status, a stand named in your honour and a statue in front of the ground.Former Notts County manager Jimmy Sirrel is immortalised in bronze alongside Jack Wheeler at Meadow Lane, with both men having had a profound influence on the club.During his first spell, Sirrel took the Magpies from Division Four to Division Two, and in his second stint - coming after two years at Sheffield United - he went on to take them all the way to the top flight.December 2006 - June 2011, January 2013 - presentEngland were World Cup holders the last time a manager other than Keith Hill led Rochdale to promotion - and he's not just done it once, but twice.The 47-year-old started out as a youth coach at Dale, and then got his chance as boss on a caretaker basis in December 2006, guiding them to League Two safety.Twice Rochdale missed out in the play-offs under Hill, before he finally got them up automatically in 2009-10 - the club's first promotion since 1969, just before he was born.He left for Barnsley in 2011 and Rochdale were relegated two seasons after his departure, but he was re-appointed at Spotland in January 2013 and led them back up again in 2014.June 2001 - September 2005, January 2012 - February 2015Latvia to Yeovil Town is probably not your average career move, but that is how Gary Johnson's association with the Glovers began in 2001.He won the 2002 FA Trophy and saw Yeovil secure promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history, before going on to guide them to League One as League Two champions in 2004-05.Johnson left for Bristol City in 2005, but later returned to Yeovil after a seven-year absence to take them up to the Championship - another first for the club.There was no happy ending for the 61-year-old, however, as they would then go on to suffer back-to-back relegations, with Johnson replaced by Paul Sturrock before their return to League Two was confirmed.1989 - 1994, April 2004 - February 2013, December 2015 - presentDagenham & Redbridge without John Still just does not seem quite right, does it?The 66-year-old's association with the club goes back to when he managed Redbridge Forest, who merged with Dagenham in 1992 to create the club that exists today.After leaving the Daggers for Peterborough in 1994, he returned 10 years later to spectacular effect, guiding them from non-league all the way up to League One.Unfortunately for Still, he has since taken them all the way back down again - suffering relegation to League Two in 2011 and then, following a stint with Luton, relegation to the National League in May.The list of returning managers is a long one, from Steve McClaren at Derby County and Danny Wilson at Barnsley to Ronnie Moore at Tranmere Rovers and Graham Taylor with Watford.But we want to hear what you think - send us your suggestions on the best or worst manager returns by using #bbcefl on Twitter, with a selection to be used in BBC Sport's EFL live text commentary on Saturday.^Jose Mourinho famously did it with Chelsea, Nigel Pearson crucially did it with Leicester City and Luiz Felipe Scolari even did it with Brazil.
Lawyers for Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman made the admission following action by ClientEarth.But Judge Mr Justice Mitting said any enforcement action was a matter for the European Commission.He refused to make any declaration, or to order Mrs Spelman to outline plans for cutting pollution levels.ClientEarth had complained that Mrs Spelman had failed to consult on proposals which demonstrated how the UK aimed to comply with EU limits on levels of nitrogen dioxide.It asked the judge to declare that plans set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not comply with EU law, and order Mrs Spelman to publish revised proposals.Government lawyers challenged the claim and said no High Court order was needed.Mr Justice Mitting said a lawyer had conceded that "the government is in breach of obligations" but said he would not make any "mandatory order".He said the government could admit the breach and "leave it to the (European) Commission to take whatever action is right in enforcement"."Such a mandatory order... would raise serious political and economic questions which are simply not for a judge," he added."Courts have traditionally been wary of entering this area of political debate - for good reason."Mr Justice Mitting pronounced the action a "draw" and said costs should be shared.A spokesperson for Defra said it was happy that "the judge has ruled on our favour"."A significant part of the UK meets EU air quality limits for all pollutants and air quality has improved considerably in recent decades."Our air quality plans set out all the important work being done at national, regional and local level to meet all EU limits in the shortest possible time," the spokesperson said.Stephen Hockman QC, for ClientEarth, told the court the charity had achieved something and said: "The government is in breach of its obligations under European law in relation to air quality."Although we have lost, it was a reasonable case to advance."A spokesman said the legal challenge had been brought because air quality plans for 17 regions and cities would not comply with legal limits for air quality until after 2015, when the deadline for achieving the limits was 1 January 2010.He said he had wanted the court to order Mrs Spelman to draw up plans that would achieve legal compliance throughout the UK by 2015, and also to make a declaration that she was in breach of her legal obligations.ClientEarth chief executive James Thornton said: "The government's plans to tackle air pollution are frankly pathetic. They contain almost no new measures and show that they won't achieve air quality limits until 2025. It's nothing short of a disgrace."^The government has admitted breaching European Union pollution legislation, during a High Court battle with environmental campaign group.
Wayan Mirna Solihin, 27, met with two friends in a Jakarta cafe on January 6.She collapsed after complaining about her coffee's taste and died a short time later.Traces of cyanide were found in her coffee and tests confirmed she had been poisoned, but Indonesian officials have not named a suspect.Ms Solihin's best friend Jessica Kumala ordered the coffee, but has denied any knowledge of the cyanide.Ms Kumala's lawyer and uncle Yudi Wibowo said a third friend, Hani, had also tried the coffee."That means Mirna did not die because of the coffee. Two people drank the same coffee but Hani is alive and well," Mr Wibowo was quoted as saying in the Jakarta Post.The friends had reportedly studied together in at design colleges and university in Australia.Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed in a statement that they had been asked to investigate the women's links from their time in Sydney and Melbourne.The statement said the AFP would consider the request but did not make further comment on the case.^Indonesian police have asked for Australia to help investigate the case of a woman who died after drinking cyanide-laced coffee.
The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land.Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere.The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires."Pines are well adapted to fire today," said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada."The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree."The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry."It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out," Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News."They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there."The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland.Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily.They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed.Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires."One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet," explained Dr Falcon-Lang."These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees."Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens.He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.Follow Helen on Twitter.^Scientists have discovered the oldest-known fossil of a pine tree.
Torrents of water brought down a suspended ceiling and damaged stock in the Victoria Centre store at about 22:40 BST on Tuesday.Managers had hoped for a weekend reopening but it is now closed "until further notice".Staff have been helping with the clean-up operation.Water poured through from a rooftop room, leaving the top floor under three inches of water and stock "significantly" damaged.A spokeswoman said: "Our teams are working around the clock to get the shop open as quickly as possible and we're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused to our customers."^John Lewis's Nottingham store is to remain closed longer than expected after 80,000 litres of hot water leaked from a ruptured heating pipe.
More than 30 firefighters helped to tackle the blaze on Great Eastern Street in Shoreditch from 03:45 BST.LFB has since apologised after its joke about the fire was met with a mixed response on social media.It said: "Sorry if we caused any offence by using the term hipsters."LFB added: "Hope #Shoreditch businesses are back on their feet soon."An investigation into the cause of the blaze is due to begin.The apology came after criticism of the joke on social media. Mike O'Brien tweeted "enough with the hipster jokes. People's livelihoods have been ruined".Others were more amused with Twitter user Debbie commending the brigade for a "great job", saying the hipster comment "made me spit my tea out".However, Pete Carrier tweeted to say "are you worried that Met Police Helecopter [sic] are getting all the attention?"His comment made reference to a situation earlier this week when the National Police Air Support Unit in London came under criticism for zooming in and taking a photograph of comedian Michael McIntyre before posting it on its Twitter account.^A building housing a pop-up restaurant in east London has been partially destroyed by fire, but "fortunately no hipsters were injured", London Fire Brigade (LFB) has said.
The money for Bridgwater Community Hospital is part of the coalition's £330m investment for new NHS facilities across England.Once built, the new hospital will have 30 inpatient beds, a midwifery-led maternity unit, a minor injury unit and X-ray and space for mobile scanners.The current hospital was built in 1813, but it has become cramped and outdated.The total cost of the project is £33m and the remaining balance will be paid for by NHS Somerset and Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.Matron Sue Taylor said: "It's very old and in the summer it's very, very hot. In the winter it's quite cold, there's lots of maintenance, lots of running repairs - it's a poor old tired building now."Sometimes your environment can have such an impact when you're trying to recover from an illness - we make the best of what we've got but when you walk into a new build it just lifts you and gives you that feeling of well-being."There is a real lovely feel about this hospital and for many years it's served us well, but we need something more modern."In the past five years, three out of Somerset's 13 community hospitals have been replaced.Work has also got under way on the new Jubilee Building at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.Dr Donal Hynes, a Bridgwater GP and medical director at Somerset Primary Care Trust, said: "It will make a huge difference for me and my relationship with my patients."This is a great vote of confidence of the developments that have been achieved in Somerset where GPs, nurses, and therapists have got together to deliver a whole package of care that can be delivered in a one-stop shop setting."Somerset PCT hopes to build the new hospital on land at Bowers Lane, which will depend on planning permission.The aim is to get the hospital finished by autumn 2014.^A community hospital in Somerset is to be replaced and rebuilt with a £16m grant from the government.
Rory Gallagher's side have recovered from the disappointment of their heavy Ulster semi-final defeat to Tyrone with narrow wins over Longford and Meath.Galway enter into Round 4A of the qualifier series after surrendering their Connacht title to Roscommon.Cian Mulligan is the only injury concern for Donegal with a quad strain.Following their nine point loss to Tyrone in the Ulster championship, Donegal returned to winning ways with a hard-fought victory over Longford and then came out on top of a thrilling shoot-out against Meath earlier this month.2012 Footballer of the Year Karl Lacey will equal Christy Toye's record of 65 championship appearances for Donegal if he features on Saturday.Galway had a strong start to their season when they beat Kildare to finish top of Division Two of the National League and earned promotion to Division One for next season.Kevin McStay's side beat arch-rivals Mayo in their Connacht championship semi-final but they will be disappointed with the way they lost their provincial title after a heavy nine-point loss to Roscommon in the Connacht final.^Donegal are hoping the momentum they have gained through the qualifier series can carry them through to the All Ireland quarter-finals.
Catherine Seeley was subjected to the abuse after she was co-opted as a Sinn Féin councillor in Craigavon, County Armagh.She thanked pupils at the Boys' Model School in the loyalist Ballysillan area for their "full support".Ms Seeley was speaking at Sinn Fein's annual conference in Wexford.She said: "In the past few weeks, in my role as a teacher, I have been subjected to a campaign of sectarian intimidation."I have already expressed my warm thanks to all who have offered me support, including family, friends, colleagues, educationalists and politicians from various parties."I want to take this opportunity to publicly send a message of gratitude to those pupils of the Boys' Model School in north Belfast who have courageously offered me their full support."They are a testimony to the values that should permeate not just education but every aspect of society.  They inspire hope and confidence in me for the future."She added that her recent experience had shown "that students can be much wiser, more mature, more responsible and more respectful than some who claim to speak on their behalf".Ms Seeley's decision to leave her post was announced on Friday in a joint statement by the school's board of governors and the Belfast Education and Library Board.She is to move to another education board area.The Protestant Coalition group had objected to her employment at the school.It said her role at the school should be looked at because of her political views.During his speech, the Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness contrasted the response of Miss Seeley's pupils to that of some unionist politicians."If this situation was reversed and a young Protestant teacher who was also a member of the DUP was being forced from her job in a Catholic school, I would be at the door accompanying her to her work," he said.Mr McGuinness also called on those he described as "sensible people within unionism" to use their influence to secure a deal on flags, parades and the past.Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams told delegates during his address on Saturday evening that the issue of contentious Orange parades still needed to be resolved."While there may be obstacles, be sure of one thing - change will not be stopped," he said."I am happy to meet with the Orange Order at any time to discuss these matters."I want to see the Orange treating its Catholic neighbours with respect."I want to see it upholding law and order."The Orange Order of Ireland is one of our national traditions."And Sinn Féin wants all our traditions freed up from sectarianism from any quarter, to live together in peace and respect and with tolerance from everyone for everyone."^The teacher who quit her job at a north Belfast school after being targeted by online sectarian abuse has spoken publicly for the first time.
Staffordshire bull terrier Ziggy was found in remote woodland near Wansford in Peterborough on Wednesday morning.X-rays showed the weapon had just missed his skull and vital organs.RSPCA Insp Justin Stubbs helped a vet "slowly, slowly pull the bolt out" of the sedated dog. "It was a heart in the mouth moment but Ziggy is making a fantastic recovery," he said.The two-year-old dog had been deliberately shot. It was "a very intentional shot at very close range", the RSPCA said.It is thought Ziggy only survived by moving his head "at the right time".An examination of his injuries showed Ziggy had been roaming the woods for a few days, "terrified and in complete agony", before being found by two walkers.Despite having a 50cm (20ins) carbon fibre bolt embedded from one side of his head to the other, Ziggy was still wagging his tail and wanting people to make a fuss of him, Mr Stubbs said.However, the vet was faced with the task of removing the weapon."It had missed Ziggy's brain, ears, eyes and skull bone by millimetres, but X-rays don't show up major blood vessels," Mr Stubbs said."It really was a heart in the mouth moment and hoping for the best, but we had everything in place in case anything happened."When the bolt was slowly inched out, Mr Stubbs, the vet and a nurse realised it had not hit any blood vessels."I don't think anyone took a breath for about a minute. Then there was a collective sigh of relief," Mr Stubbs said."It had just gone through soft tissue and didn't even hit muscle."Ziggy is now being looked after at nearby kennels where he is said to be making "a miraculous recovery"."He is bounding around as if nothing happened," Mr Stubbs said."If ever a dog had a guardian angel, Ziggy had one that day."The RSPCA is continuing to investigate and has appealed for information about the attack.^The delicate operation to remove a crossbow bolt embedded in a dog's head took "just one minute", the RSPCA said.
A team from Glasgow University found there was a sharp fall in accidents from 5,901 in 1997 to 2,914 in 2014.The researchers said, however, there was "no evidence" the M74 had impacted on an "already decreasing trend".The five-mile (8km) route, which cost Â£692m, links the M74 at Carmyle to the M8 southwest of the Kingston Bridge.Planning permission for the route was granted in October 1995 and immediately opposed by Joint Action Against the M74 (Jam74) - a coalition of community, environmental and sustainable transport groups.Construction began in 2008 after a last-ditch legal bid to halt the project was abandoned by Friends of the Earth Scotland and Jam74.Supporters claimed the road would bring economic benefits to the west of Scotland and help cut accidents, whereas critics argued it would cause more pollution, increase health problems and fragment communities.The Glasgow University study looked to evaluate the impact of the M74 extension on the number of road accidents on local roads during the construction period and following its opening.Lead author of the report, Dr Jonathan Olsen, said: "The building of the M74 extension in the south of Glasgow was controversial. There were strong arguments for and against its construction, but ultimately it went ahead."One of the arguments in favour was that it could reduce road accidents on local streets."In our study we examined police accident data from 1997 to 2014, three years after the new motorway was opened, and found that this predicted reduction in road accident numbers had not materialised."He added: "But on the other hand, we found no evidence that the M74 extension had led to an increase in accidents."Report co-author, Professor Rich Mitchell, added: "There is surprisingly little evidence about the impacts new motorways have."This research will be useful for planners, politicians and residents elsewhere who are trying to decide whether to build or not."The study is published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.^The controversial M74 extension through Glasgow has had little impact on road traffic accidents in the city since it opened in 2011, a new study has found.
An investigation into Pembrokeshire council's dealings with Michael Smith said it was "only luck" that stopped his application.The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph.It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith.Pembrokeshire council said "it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice".Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012.During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings.Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home.The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith "displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time".Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy.He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child.He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children.The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer.The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application.The report said the head of service had "replied in very positive terms".A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to "highlight any concerns" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes.The head of service left the section blank.It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined.The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer."By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action," the report said."It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005" and "only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer".There have been calls to make the report public.The latest request took place at full council on 2 March when Cllr Mike Stoddart had put forward a notice of motion asking for it to be published.He said it is in "the public interest to publish the report so that the electorate can be fully apprised of the chain of events surrounding this issue."His motion was defeated by a single vote.A statement from Pembrokeshire council said: "The report contains personal information in relation to children, parents and professionals, and the report was made available to members on this basis. Further publication of this report was restricted."On making the report available to all members, they were made aware that there are families in the area who remain affected by the actions of Mr Smith, and were reminded of their corporate obligation to safeguard everyone in the community."^An ex-youth worker jailed for child sex offences could have been approved as a foster carer, a case review has found.
Lord Forsyth of Drumlean said the SNP election result was a "revolution" and could not be overlooked.Meanwhile, former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling said Mr Cameron had the chance of "building a constitution for the 21st century".The SNP won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats at Westminster last week.Mr Darling added that in his opinion the rising success of the SNP had "completely  overtaken" any agreements made in the Smith Commission - which outlined increased devolution proposals in the wake of the independence referendum last year.Lord Forsyth, a Conservative peer, told the BBC that the big advantage of giving Scotland more powers was that it would prevent SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon producing "fantasy manifestos" without raising the cash to pay for it.He said: "I think we have to recognise what happened in Scotland last Thursday was a revolution."The Conservative in me was full of joy for what David Cameron had achieved but the unionist is greatly dismayed."We used to say if the SNP won a majority in seats in Scotland then they could have independence."They got 50% of the vote and 95% of the seats and the reality is you have to respond to that and I think what the government needs to do is produce a White Paper which sets out how fiscal autonomy, devo-max, call it what you will, would work in practice so people are aware of the advantages and the disadvantages."The Conservatives have outlined in their manifesto an "English votes for English laws" proposal, which would give MPs for English seats a veto on issues which affect only England, including on income tax.Mr Cameron promised firm proposals within 100 days of forming a government, which would be "fully implemented" by the time of the Budget in March of the following year.But Mr Darling warned that such a law could break up the union.He told the BBC: "...by saying that essentially English MPs will decide tax and spending, you are well on the way to breaking up the Union."SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has previously said if there were matters that were genuinely English only, and had no impact in Scotland, there would be "a strong case" for Scottish MPs not voting on them."The problem is there's a lot of issues characterised as English-only issues that are anything but - matters relating to the English health service for example."Decisions taken on that have a direct impact on Scotland's budget," she said.Ms Sturgeon is referring to the system used to allocate funds to devolved governments. These sums are dictated - via the Barnett formula - by the figure allocated to services such as health and education in England.^The government needs to set out how it will devolve further fiscal powers to Scotland following the rise of the SNP, a former Scottish secretary has said.
The 25-year-old American born striker made 37 appearances and scored seven goals during his 12 months at Tynecastle.Johnsen also made his first international appearance for Norway while a Hearts player.The Edinburgh club has strengthened up front, signing Kyle Lafferty during this transfer window.Johnsen was brought to Hearts by former head coach Robbie Neilson after leaving Bulgarian club Litex Lovech.And Neilson's successor, Ian Cathro, had to deny reports of an argument with the striker at half-time during a game against St Johnstone in May.Den Haag, managed by Alfons Groenendijk, the former Manchester City midfielder and former Ajax assistant, finished 11th in the Eredivisie last season.^Hearts have sold Bjorn Johnsen to Dutch top-rlight club ADO Den Haag for an undisclosed transfer fee.

Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe Briton, 21, led after the second round with a personal best of 6.81m, but she was pipped to gold by France's Eloyse Lesueur who leapt out to 6.85m.The men's 4x400m team also won silver, while the women's quartet and Andrew Osagie, in the 800m, won bronze as Team GB finished with six medals.The Briton was promoted to third after Marcin Lewandowski was disqualified.Team GB lodged a protest after Osagie noted that the Pole had stepped off the track during the race. Following a review, the Harlow athlete was declared the bronze medallist. Ethiopia's Mohammed Aman, 20, won gold and Poland's Adam Kszczot took silver.In the women's 4x400m, Christine Ohuruogu had to hold off a strong challenge from Russia on the final leg to secure bronze for her team. The United States won the title by almost two seconds in 3:24.83, while Jamaica took silver.And in the final race of the three-day competition, the men's 4x400m, Nigel Levine produced a fine run to stay ahead of Jamaica's Edino Steele on the final leg as Britain claimed silver. Their time of 3:03.49 was a season's best, but more than a second behind winners USA, who set a new world indoor record of 3:02.13."Six medals satisfies me," UK Athletics performance director Neil Black told BBC Sport. "This is a young developing team. Six is a strong basis for going forward."Earlier, Johnson-Thompson - competing in the long jump after she was unable to qualify for her preferred event, pentathlon, because of illness - opened up with 6.69m, before eclipsing her previous best of 6.75m, set at the recent British championships, with 6.81m.That gave her the outright lead and it appeared the Liverpool Harrier was set to pick up her first major international title, but 2012 European outdoor champion Lesueur went further on her fourth attempt.Johnson-Thompson could not reproduce the form of the early rounds as France secured their first medal of the championships.Bronze went to Serbia's Ivana Spanovic (6.77m), with Johnson-Thompson's team-mate Shara Proctor fourth with 6.68m."I can't believe I won my first medal in an event not my own," the Briton said. "It feels incredible. I came here with no expectations.""I was winning at one point, but Lesueur was the best today. I couldn't respond to her 6.85m."I'm still very much a pentathlete-heptathlete. The heptathlon is what I want to concentrate on in the summer. The Commonwealth Games is my main focus and hopefully I'll do the long jump or high jump at the Europeans."There was disappointment for Britain on the final day as Holly Bleasdale finished ninth in the pole vault.The 22-year-old from Preston, who won bronze in 2012 and has a personal best of 4.87m, failed to clear 4.65m.Team-mate Asha Philip was fourth in the 60m final, won by Olympic 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce of Jamaica in 6.98 seconds.Britons Andrew Pozzi and Will Sharman also failed to make the podium, finishing fourth and seventh respectively in the 60m hurdles final, which was won by American Omo Osaghae in 7.45 secs.Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba, who set three world bests in a month earlier this year, won the 3,000m in 8:55.04, while Qatar's Mutaz Essa Barshim cleared 2.38m to clinch men's high jump gold on countback - his first major senior title.^Katarina Johnson-Thompson won her first major medal with silver in the long jump at the World Indoor Championships.
Nearly 1.85 million requests for support were made last year, but just over 650,000 people received help.Councils have been warning for a number of years that a shortage of funding is causing problems.But the Health and Social Care Information Centre figures shows how difficult it is for people to get help.Only 144,000 of the requests for help resulted in long-term care, which includes places in care homes or help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing.Nearly 220,000 got short-term help, such as rehabilitation after discharge from hospital, and another 300,000 got low-level support such as walking aids and telecare.The rest either received nothing or were advised to seek help from charities, the NHS or from housing services.Unlike the NHS, social care is not free and most people will pay something towards the cost of their care, with some covering the entire cost.Meanwhile, a separate survey of nearly 70,000 people who did get help revealed their experiences of care.Some 65% said they were extremely or very satisfied with their care and 26% were quite satisfied, but one in 10 was not.One in 20 did not feel clean or presentable and the same proportion said they did not always get enough food and drink.Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said the figures painted an "alarming picture of services cut back to the bare bones"."This is a direct result of £4.6bn cuts to social care budgets since 2010 and comes despite an ageing population which is increasing the need for these services," she added.The figures come after a coalition of health and care groups wrote to the Treasury last month warning that the care sector needed to be protected as the "deepening crisis" was putting people in danger.The government said its spending plans would be revealed in November, but pointed out that a £5.4bn fund - the Better Care Fund - had been established in April to ensure NHS money was used for services that support council-organised care.But Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: "We need to see a change to the current perverse funding system which, over the last five years, has seen an increase in funding for the NHS but a decrease in funding for social care."This threatens to leave councils struggling to commission the essential support which keeps people out of hospital and living healthier and happier lives in their communities."^Two-thirds of older and disabled people in England who turn to their local councils for help with care are turned away, figures show.
Burials were held for 33 of the 84 people whose bodies have been recovered. Several local people are still missing.Thousands of people gathered in the square outside the town's main church to pay their respects in front of a long row of coffins.Rescue workers are still searching the local river for victims.One resident of Salgar particularly hard hit is the city's cemetery worker who has prepared 15 graves for members of his own family - mostly cousins who died in the flood.A spokesman for the national emergency authorities said he expected to end the search for victims on Thursday or Friday.He said between 20 and 25 local people caught in the flood had not been accounted for.Locals and firefighters have been searching a 40km-long (25 mile) stretch of land on the banks of the Liboriana river.Most of the residents were asleep when the landslide hit at 03:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Monday.The landslide was triggered by heavy rains that sent torrents of water and mud crashing into the La Liboriana ravine, causing an overflow that destroyed the neighbourhood below.^A mass funeral has taken place in the Colombian town of Salgar for victims of a devastating mudslide on Monday.
The portal, for the match against Poland, will be open to supporters on a priority list who were were informed they had missed out on Tuesday.UEFA is to make about 1,000 extra tickets available to Northern Ireland fans.Northern Ireland are  to play Poland, Ukraine and Germany in France in June.On Tuesday, the IFA said it was "inundated" with calls from angry Northern Ireland fans unable to purchase tickets.Some fans who said they ranked near the top of the IFA's 'priority list' missed out on tickets for the Poland game.Particularly affected were fans who applied for category 3 tickets, the second cheapest kind."We discovered there was an issue yesterday morning on this with quite a number of people finding they hadn't got tickets in category 3 for the Poland game," IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson said."We got straight onto Uefa and with Uefa's senior management team, we've worked through that issue now. We've identified with Uefa that there's almost another 1,000 tickets that they're going to make available for us, particularly for those fans."The 900 or so fans that we're talking about here will have priority access, in fact specific access, to a portal that Uefa are setting up and they should be able to buy tickets."We've been talking to Uefa for not quite the last 24 hours, but probably 21 of the last 24 hours over this and we're fairly confident that Uefa will manage this in the right way."A points system had been put in place for the games to establish a priority list for tickets, favouring fans who had attended the most matches at home and abroad.However, on Tuesday Gary McAllister from the Amalgamation of Official NI Supporters Clubs said many fans were now asking whether the loyalty scheme has been implemented correctly.He missed out on a ticket to the Poland game, despite having 27 loyalty points out of a possible 29.In the Republic of Ireland, fans have not yet heard if they have been successful in securing tickets.Irish Times chief football writer Emmet Malone said the experience of Northern Ireland supporters has worried fans in the Republic of Ireland.Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Wednesday, Mr Malone said there was "a lot of pessimism" among Ireland fans."The FAI [Football Association of Ireland] is supposed to start informing people, possibly as early as this afternoon, as to who got tickets here," he said."But our applications were far more oversubscribed than the IFA's, so a lot of people are very concerned about what will happen."Mr Malone said there was particular concern that the FAI's loyalty scheme was only introduced in 2015, so is it relatively new."The FAI have  been quite vague with fan groups over requests to publish the points that everybody has, how the categories break down, who's going to be compared with who in terms of pecking order."That vagueness is going to lead to an awful lot of bad feeling here over the next few days."^The Irish Football Association has said Uefa will set up a portal for Northern Ireland supporters to apply for extra European Championship tickets.
Timm van der Gugten, Michael Hogan, Graham Wagg and Craig Meschede took on the bulk of the fast bowling duties across all three formats in 2016.Van der Gugten was the leading wicket-taker with a haul of 82."You can never have enough good fast bowlers, so that would be top of the shopping list," Morris said."If we can find some money in the bank, we need to supplement our fast bowling department, of that there's no doubt."Timm van der Gugten proved what an excellent cricketer he is. He was a really good addition."Australia-born Netherlands international Van der Gugten joined Glamorgan before the 2016 season.Teenager Lukas Carey topped the Championship averages with 13 wickets in three games, but Ruaidhri Smith was limited to one match by university commitments and injury.The county hope that leading batsmen Colin Ingram and Chris Cooke will be fit to resolve their batting problems after long-standing injuries.Ingram is hoping for a comeback in South Africa by November after a knee operation on the problem that restricted him to limited-overs cricket in 2016.Cooke is due to step up training in late October 2016 after being laid low by a back problem in May, although he was advised against surgery."There's no doubt they left a big hole in our side this year, two of our most experienced and best batters," admitted Morris.He is also hoping for a bigger contribution from captain Jacques Rudolph, who managed just 659 Championship runs."Jacques had a really disappointing summer, he's been a professional cricketer for 19 years and this was his most challenging summer," Morris added."But I know what a proud man he is and a good player and he's determined to turn that round."Morris says a record of three wins and eight losses in the Championship was disappointing, but points to the progress made by younger players.Aneurin Donald, David Lloyd, Nick Selman, Owen Morgan and Kiran Carlson all hit maiden Championship 100s in 2016.^Glamorgan have made signing another fast bowler their priority for 2017, says chief executive Hugh Morris.
The man, who was in his 60s, died at Silverthorn Avenue in the town and police were informed of his death just after 12:00 GMT on Tuesday.Officers investigating the circumstances of his death arrested a 25-year-old man in Coleraine just after 17:30 GMT.There are no further details at present.^Police are treating the death of a man in Coleraine, County Londonderry, as suspicious and have made an arrest.
The former Barcelona and Ajax forward died of cancer, aged 68, on Thursday.His family say they will hold a private funeral for the three-time European Footballer of the Year, while a public memorial will also be organised."It has touched us deeply that Johan was such an inspiration to many of you," said ex-Manchester United midfielder Jordi in a statement."On behalf of my mother, sisters and the rest of the family I would like to say thank you for all the love, kind words and memories that have been shared with us, since yesterday but also over the past months," added the 42-year-old, who played under his father at Barcelona.Cruyff, who led Barca to their first European Cup in 1992 and also managed Ajax, is widely considered to be one of the world's greatest ever players.Figures from the world of football, Dutch politicians and royalty were among those to pay tribute on Thursday.^Jordi Cruyff has expressed thanks for the tributes to his father, Dutch footballing great Johan Cruyff.
Van Gaal, 65, has been out of work since being sacked by United hours after winning the FA Cup in May 2016."I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching," Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ.He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football.He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month."So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts," he added.The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East.Media playback is not supported on this deviceVan Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax.He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title.Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey.His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986.The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone.Media playback is not supported on this deviceHe then guided AZ Alkmaar to the 2005-06 Eredivisie title before moving to the Bundesliga, where he helped Bayern Munich to the 2009-10 Bundesliga title.The Dutch national side approached Van Gaal again in 2012 and this time the Netherlands became one of the first two European countries, along with Italy, to qualify for Brazil 2014, where they finished in third place.After much speculation, he joined United in May 2014, signing a three-year contract to succeed David Moyes.However, United replaced him with Jose Mourinho after just two years following a fifth-placed Premier League finish in the 2015-16 season, with a first FA Cup triumph since 2004 not sufficient to save him.^Ex-Manchester United and Netherlands boss Louis van Gaal says he has retired from coaching after a 26-year career.
Homosexual acts are illegal in the East African nation and punishable by up to 30 years in jail.Those who advertised homosexual activities online would also be targeted, the politician warned.Tweeters accused him of homophobia and infringing on the right to freedom of expression online.But Hamisi Kigwangalla argued that homosexuality did not scientifically exist and was a social construct.In a tweet written in Swahili and English he said: "Have you ever come across a gay goat or bird? Homosexuality is not biological, it is unnatural."The 42-year-old, who is a medical doctor by profession, argued that homosexuality could only be associated with an urban lifestyle.He said that in the small town in central Tanzania where he came from, there were no homosexuals.Tweeter: "Consider the fact that your move will only fuel more hatred, violence and increased mob lynchings"Response: "Fulfils my duty as head administrator of the rules and policies of our country! I do not have any trouble with the 'community'"Tweeter : "Freedom of choice, freedom of expression and right to privacy are constitutional justifiable rights. May God change your heart"Response: "Freedoms/rights have boundaries and both are protected by law! The law in Tanzania has boundaries when it comes to sexuality"Tweeter: "It seems politics has made you forget the basics of science. Homosexuality is partly a result of biogenetics"Response: "There is no literature to suggest so. Homosexuality has no any scientific backing! I am a scientist and I read a lot than you think"Earlier this month, Dr Kigwangalla ordered three men he accused of being gay to report to the police for "spreading" homosexual activity through social media, in violation of the law.It is not clear whether they have been charged.Dr Kigwangalla's outspoken comments on Twitter follow the health ministry's move last week to suspend the activities of 40 drop-in HIV/Aids clinics, accusing non-governmental organisations of using them to promote gay sex.The BBC's Sammy Awami in Dar es Salaam says most Tanzanians are strongly opposed to homosexuality - and the gay community keeps to itself.But homosexuality was named as one of the three major challenges facing the country in a parliamentary debate about Aids earlier this month.MP Hussein Bashe said the other issues were drug use and poor education.^The threat to publish the names of suspected homosexuals in Tanzania has been defended by the deputy health minister in a fierce row on Twitter.
Police said that someone opened fire from a passing car and witnesses spoke of up to a dozen shots being fired close to the main police station."Nothing is known about the culprits yet but we can guess that this involves local crime gangs," investigators told German media.The suspects fled and the area was quickly cordoned off.The shots were fired in Friedrich-Stoltze Square, a busy area of bars and cafes, as local people enjoyed the Ascension Day holiday in the sunshine.^At least three people were wounded, two seriously, when shots were fired in the German city of Frankfurt on Thursday.
The Â£21.5m Castle Mill development at Port Meadow, by the River Thames, has been widely criticised as ugly and spoiling the view of Oxford's skyline.The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) will put its case to a High Court judge on 23 October.The five-storey university blocks provide 439 accommodation units.The flats overlook a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.CPRE is seeking the judicial review on the basis of Oxford City Council not carrying out an environmental impact assessment.The council has said the challenge was late as the housing had already been built, and it believed the group's claims were unfounded.Helen Marshall, director of CPRE Oxfordshire, said the West Area Planning Committee "should under no circumstances be rushed into making further poor decisions"."We are not yet convinced that the planning condition on contamination has been met," she added."And the mitigation proposals currently suggested by the university are woefully inadequate to counteract the devastating impact of the buildings on Port Meadow and Oxford's historic skyline."A few trees growing to approximately half the height of the buildings in 15 years' time will not meet the brief of 'hiding the buildings in summer and softening their impact in winter'"Key issues such as the height of the buildings and light pollution still need to be addressed."A University of Oxford spokesman said it had "thought carefully" about how best to mitigate the impact of the buildings."Some measures have already been put in place, and discussions with the city council and others are ongoing about what more we can do," he added."The University will be making representations at the interim hearing in October on the procedural issues raised by the challenge."In the meantime, we intend to finish and occupy the buildings by the start of the next academic year in October as planned."The city council said last month it was carrying out an independent review into the case.An online petition against the development on Roger Dudman Way has attracted more than 3,000 signatures.^A campaign group has been granted a hearing to examine the case for a judicial review of the decision to build student flats near a beauty spot.

The two brothers allegedly sold Musadikur Rohaman's BMW car, his wife's wedding dress and Â£1,200 worth of family gold to raise funds for him in Syria.The two men, from Walsall, West Midlands, deny terrorism funding offences. Another two men, also appearing at the Old Bailey, deny funding offences.All four say the money was to help Musadikur come back to the UK.Prosecuting, Julian Christopher QC, said dry cleaners Mohammed Hussain, 26, and Mohamed Rohaman, 32, collected a total of Â£10,000 for their brother, a fighter in Raqqa.Musadikur and his wife Zohura Siddeka, a teacher, both 27, left for Syria in December 2014."Musadikur had told people that he was going on holiday, but the true purpose for his trip was to go to Syria to join and fight for IS, and that is what he did," Mr Christopher said.Mr Hussain also recruited family friends Mohammed Khan, 27 and Maruf Uddin, 26, both accountants, to help raise funds by taking out credit card loans and selling valuables, Mr Christopher said."This case concerns the steps which these four defendants took, in various different ways, to help Musadikur by sending money out to him, by selling items belonging to him and his wife, by obtaining a credit card and by extracting money from his and his wife's bank accounts."^A mother locked up valuables to stop two sons selling them to raise money for another son fighting for the so-called Islamic State, it is claimed.
Officers searched properties in the Waterfront Park and Colonsay View areas of the city on Wednesday.Detectives said three firearms, ammunition and a five-figure sum of money were recovered.A 26-year-old man who was arrested and charged appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday.^A man has appeared in court after firearms, ammunition and cash were seized by police in Edinburgh.
The 10 men and three women, aged from 22 to 54, are from Lincolnshire and West Yorkshire and are due to appear in court next month.Ten face charges of conspiracy to hold another person in slavery or servitude.Two have been charged with cheating the public revenue, and another person has been charged with false representation and possession of criminal property.They are due to appear at Lincoln Magistrates' Court on 28 October.Seven of those charged are from Washingborough Road, Lincoln; five from Drinsey Nook, near Saxilby; and one from Kinsley in West Yorkshire.The charges follow a joint operation involving police and the National Crime Agency, during which a number of traveller sites were raided, including Drinsey Nook and Washingborough Road.^Thirteen people have been charged after a police operation against modern slavery.
For Volkswagen, the reaction to the revelations that it deliberately tried to game tests supposed to reduce pollution will be as vital in determining the long term damage to the company as the fact of the original offence.Today's review of how Thomas Cook dealt with the deaths of Bobbi and Christi Shepherd in 2006 shows how the tragedy was then compounded by the company's reaction - a company, it should be noted, which says it tries to "consistently meet and exceed the expectations of its customers".Take one small example - Thomas Cook's response to a request from the family for legal support during the inquest.In 2014, the company turned down the request, only reversing their position after Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's chief executive, met Sharon Wood and Neil Shepherd, Bobbi and Christi's parents, this year."The fact that this tragic situation spanned almost 9 years is testimony to how much the legal rather than human considerations dominated the landscape," Justin King writes in his report.Earlier attempts by the family to meet previous chief executives were rebuffed or ignored, Mr King reveals.He makes it clear that at the time of the tragedy the company was focused on "financial, contracting, the airlines and destination" and has only recently been "moving to create a real customer focus".The report says that the "destination management" process - which encompasses the famous "holiday rep" that is often the first point of call for holidaymakers - saw its role as the "maximisation of revenue for the minimum of cost".That can lead to tensions and a "misalignment of goals", with cost cutting leading to less time spent with holidaymakers and failing online systems.In one instance, Mr King reveals, IT systems are so poor, staff in holiday destinations cannot access the Thomas Cook website.In such an environment health and safety - often the general butt of jokes about officialdom gone mad - can appear a Cinderella service, under-resourced and under-powered.Indeed Mr King says that Thomas Cook's Health and Safety Management System, despite being an "excellent framework", suffered from "a number of significant shortcomings in [its] implementation and operation".How many businesses could confidently say that was not the same in their company?Even now, Mr King believes that, the new contract Thomas Cook has signed for the provision of health and safety auditing within the company is "at the lower end of the scale, reflecting budgetary constraints"."Adequate" is the best Mr King can say of the present approach, and information on customer complaints - often an early warning of problems - is "not collected with sufficient robustness", he says.Different parts of the business operate in silos, and the sharing of information is not what it should be.Every company chief executive should read Mr King's report. And reflect on now many of the problems he has identified are also true of the businesses they run.^In an era when there is considerable suspicion about the motivation of businesses, the ability of a company to react to a crisis in a way that reveals it to be run by human beings rather than faceless chief executives is of paramount importance.
Media playback is not supported on this deviceImagine for a moment you are privileged enough to be on your way to Monaco to witness F1's greatest race in any way you choose. How do you do it?Standing on one of Monte Carlo's neoclassical verandas overlooking Casino Square - champagne flute in hand?Maybe take in some lobster and fine wine as the cars race by at any given restaurant lining the circuit?Perhaps the Paddock Club, for a grandstand seat and a place in the harbour at the Monaco Yacht Club....Or being bent over the boiling exhaust of a Formula 1 car whilst wearing a race suit in 80-degree heat?"I got to wear me own suit and helmet in the garage. I really didn't want to do the VIP thing, so I was in charge of Eddie Irvine's right-rear tyre," remembers Jordan mechanic, and multi-million album-selling, car-themed singer-songwriter Chris Rea. "I did it a few times, but the only time it was hard was at Monaco."It's the 1995 Monaco Grand Prix and Eddie Irvine is returning to the pits with a problem with his right-rear wheel. "My wheel. It was very warm and it's quite a way to run in that gear, probably because I had a terrible hangover."Thank you, Eddie Jordan."For the opportunity. And the hangover.And it was Monaco where it all began for Rea. But not amongst the F1 and entertainment world's cognoscenti. Like it does for everyone. At home in front of the telly."It was Sunday afternoon, a very small broadcast live from Monte Carlo - and Stirling Moss was leaving everybody for dead and as Moss went by as leader, down at bottom of the hill and you'd see these strange little things, and you says to your dad: "what are them?" And he'd say: 'squale' - sharks."I was only about eight. 'What's the colour?' I say, and he gets his wine, and he says: 'Blood red, son, blood red.'"'And who's that driver?' He's like a benign Darth Vader with his modern helmet on, and his name is Wolfgang Alexander von Trips, and he lives in a castle."That was it. After that night there was nothing else than the shark nose Ferrari."But it would be years before Rea turned a passion for F1 and Von Trips into the reality that he could witness at first hand…"When you grow up… that area of your life has gone - as if you have concussion, because you can't afford it."It wasn't money, or fame and the access that comes with it that handed Rea an epiphany which would lead him to witness some of F1's greatest moments with his own eyes."Many years later you're walking though Cologne on your day off from the arena, and around the corner you see this museum for Wolfgang von Trips. They just got all this stuff down from the top floor, including a box with tins of film - of all his holiday films from 1957 to 1960."I hadn't seen footage of Von Trips ever before. It's of him picking his apples in the castle and backstage at every major race. It had never been seen before and they let me have it, which is where I got the boy's dreams idea."As a way of sharing this access to Von Trips' archive and to celebrate one of F1's most iconic drivers - who was tragically killed at Monza in 1961 along with 15 spectators in one of the sport's darkest moments - Rea has rereleased his double-album and DVD La Passione 20 years after "too many people got involved the first time around".It now includes the footage that was handed to him in Von Trips' home town, and which took Rea on an F1 odyssey from a dusty museum's loft to Eddie Irvine's white hot exhaust pipe.What Rea remembers and has collected along the way competes for wall space with what he achieved in music.Rea's demo studio at his home sees walls lined with guitars gifted by Paul McCartney and The Smiths' Johnny Marr, as well as what seems like hundreds of his own - including a beguiling orange Fender Stratocaster ("that's the one I wrote Road To Hell on").But with the tools of a trade that has earned Rea a global profile for decades hang the humble achievements and notable failures of a racing career - pictures of him driving in various amateur meetings with the Historic Racing Drivers' Club, including a win at Donington and pictures of his current car of choice - a police-themed Morris Minor.Plus a bent piston from a Porsche he was driving at Monaco one year, damaged after missing a gear on his way to Rascasse corner."I think I've lost that ability to slow things down - that ability drivers have to calculate what's coming by you at tremendous speed. I used to have it. But I had to pull into the pits the other day - it was wet and I was getting in the way [of the other cars]."But it's that intuitive sense and skill where the world of motor racing and music collide - where man and machine intertwine to produce something that can never be manufactured. And often never repeated."I played at gig at the Montreax Jazz Festival once and on a song called It's All Gone - I had to do free-form slide solo. It's the best thing I've ever done - because I wasn't thinking about it. I've even watched it on YouTube and I've thought: 'I can't do that.'"It's like watching a qualifying lap - things you got away with when you were really on the edge. People tell me I've done it again, but I don't think so. It always happens on a wet night in Dresden. If I knew someone was filming it I'd fall to bits."One man who achieved a qualifying lap that he couldn't possibly explain was Ayrton Senna after his "out of body experience" in 1988. But, like so many of the great drivers, it was when the Brazilian legend was not in the best machinery that his talent shined through. And it's Monaco again where Rea takes one of his fondest F1 memories."We were doing a gig. Senna used to gain a second on everyone at Loews hairpin. It was in first gear, it was all mechanical. He used to gain a second on everybody else there."It's my favourite McLaren year, with the MP4/8 [the first car for years to lose McLaren its prowess in the filed and trail behind the emerging Williams Renaults]. To watch senna inside was amazing. Someone showed me his glove after Monaco - he'd worn through his glove."I came home with fencing marks on my face from Donington in 1993," another iconic Senna performance in under-powered machinery and in torrential conditions."I stood there for the whole race. He would drive through rivers - I don't know how it did that."While it might not be surprising to hear that a man who saw Senna and played at F1 during the '90s feels less connected with the sport these days, it gives more credence to the argument something needs to change in the sport."Look at Formula 1 now - it's Scalextric. It doesn't look now like what viciously turned people like me on - watching it, thinking: 'I can't do that. Guys with no Armco, but trees, telegraph posts… Cars that were only mechanical. It made it more special.Two young lads asked me about a 1996 YouTube video of Ferraris doing tests. They didn't remember it - they wanted to know what the hell it was, because they couldn't get over the scream of them cars going past 16,000 rpm, with V12 engines."That's not there now. Instead it's that drone. The cars all sound like an out of tune saxophone. [F1's] in a hell of a mess now.They all go up each other's bums - rules are made by scientists and it doesn't relate to the public."There's always Ferrari, right?And what of Rea's beloved Ferrari? The red cars that drew him into the dream 55 years ago? Their mini-revival fading by the race."They would try so hard. They would turn up with something so amazing, but then it would break down. Which is so Italian."But a lot of Ferrari owners are billionaires these days. And you kind of lose some of that mad men in a village outside of Modena trying to win."You can't have F1 without Ferrari - you just can't have it. It's part of the theme that is the red car, and a lot of it is to do with the colour. If a kid falls in love with Ferrari this weekend, when he eventually buys one it'll be red. And when he gets older it'll be metallic red - and he'll have a disguise on when he's driving it so no one recognises him."Rea smiles… his humour possibly anecdotal."I've given up my Ferrari - the idea of going through my village in a 488… You can't drive them on English roads."I had an F12, but I had a lot of trouble with it. The main trouble was how big the bloody things are. I used to say to Luca [de Montezemolo, ex Ferrari president], 'When can we have smaller car? Instead of this battleship.'For more than 60 years the paddock, and every veranda that lines the Monte Carlo Formula 1 circuit overflows with the rich and famous - attracted by the fine champagne, dining, bobbing yachts and gentle mistral of the Cote D'Azur, as well as maybe a few loud cars disturbing the networking.But one household name, whose memories involve old steering wheels, helmets and engine parts in a shed, was there for one thing: the racing.What kind of F1 fan is Chris Rea?

Levein, the club's director of football, described finishing fifth in the Premiership, as "frustrating and a tad disappointing"."I've got high hopes for him [Cathro]," Levein said. "This is a tough place to manage, as I know myself."The thing about here is the players like him."Levein points to mistakes in the January transfer window which saw Hearts sign nine players - six of whom have since left the club - as a chief reason for the underwhelming league campaign.Dylan Bikey, Tasos Avlonitis, Lennard Sowah, Andraz Struna and Alexandros Tziolis are all moving on while Moha Choulay is returning to parent club Stoke City."Rushed is probably a fair assessment," Levein explained."We've had six transfer windows since the club came out of administration [in 2014]. Four of them have been really good, the last two haven't been particularly good."In hindsight, should we have given longer-term contracts to some of those players? The answer is probably no."The fact we gave them short-term contracts has allowed us to still be in a position to be able to strengthen this summer and repair some of the damage."Levein says the "furore" surrounding 30-year-old Cathro since his arrival has been tough for the young head coach to deal with, but says the players enjoy working under him and will improve next season."For him to be a real success here we need to give him time and let him understand what this is all about," Levein explained. "Then we can let him go and play how he wants to play, but we need to fix some other things first."His problem early on has been understanding Scottish football, not understanding how he wants to play."In this country just now, Celtic are in a class of their own, Rangers play a different style of football to other teams, but the rest play the same."If you can't deal with long balls, second balls, wide crosses, then you can't impose yourself on the match."His early experiences have been about understanding that part of it. Once he deals with that part of it I think it will allow his coaching abilities to come to the fore."^Craig Levein retains "high hopes" for Ian Cathro's Hearts tenure but says the club will seek to "repair the damage" of recent transfer windows.
Broady and Watson struggled to make an impact in their first final as a pair with the top seeds from Chinese Taipei winning in just over an hour.It is the Chan siblings' third trophy of the year.Watson suffered a second-round singles defeat by Caroline Wozniacki, while Broady failed to get past round one.The 26-year-old was beaten 6-2 6-2 by British top seed Johanna Konta."I want to thank my partner," Broady, who reached the women's doubles third round at Wimbledon with Watson this year, told BT Sport."We've been best friends since we were about nine years old so to arrive at a final together on the same side of the net is just awesome, and I really enjoyed playing with her."^British pair Naomi Broady and Heather Watson lost 6-3 6-1 to Chan Yung-jan and Chan Hao-ching in the doubles final of the Hong Kong Open.

The judges said Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and How to Think Smarter About People Who Think Differently was a "tour de force" of journalistic and scientific research.It is the first popular science book to win the prize in its 17-year history.The shortlist had included Jonathan Bate's Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life and Robert Macfarlane's Landmarks.Historian Anne Applebaum, chair of the judges, praised Silberman's "compassionate journalism" and said he excelled at using stories and anecdotes to explain complex medical issues to a wide audience.The American author, who is based in San Francisco, has been a science writer for Wired and other magazines such as the New Yorker, the MIT Technology Review, Nature and Salon for more than 20 years."We admired Silberman's work because it is powered by a strongly argued set of beliefs: that we should stop drawing sharp lines between what we assume to be 'normal' and 'abnormal', and that we should remember how much the differently-wired human brain has, can and will contribute to our world," Applebaum said."He has injected a hopeful note into a conversation that's normally dominated by despair."Neurotribes, she added, was "a tour de force of archival, journalistic and scientific research, both deeply researched and widely accessible".In its review of Silberman's book, The Guardian described Neurotribes as "a gripping narrative written with journalistic verve".The £20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize was won last year by Helen Macdonald's H is for Hawk.^Author Steve Silberman has won the £20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction for his book about autism.

Graham Andrew bought the 33,600-piece Wildlife puzzle and recruited 200 jigsaw fans to complete it, to raise money for local charities.He was left with four holes in the giant puzzle and had to ask the Barcelona manufacturer to re-cut them.The pieces have arrived and the puzzle should be completed on Friday.Volunteers began piecing together the 5.7m (18.7ft) by 1.57m (5ft) picture of jungle creatures at a hall in Reepham on 14 August.Click here for more news, bit by bit, from NorfolkIt was almost complete two weeks later, but, as reported by ITV, four pieces were missing."Four out of 33,000 isn't that bad," Mr Andrew told the BBC."I had bought a second puzzle just in case this happened. We sifted through for ages to find the pieces, and I was thrilled when we did."However, Mr Andrew realised the jigsaws were not identical and the back-up pieces did not fit."I considered squishing them in, but decided it had to be done properly so I asked the company to re-cut them," he said.He had to send the surrounding pieces to the Spanish company so they could accurately make replacements.It is not yet known how the pieces went missing, but he said they probably fell into a handbag or "got stuck on a granny's cardigan" as she was helped out.Mr Andrew raised funds for the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital children's wards and Reepham nursery by asking people to sponsor puzzle pieces.The jigsaw will be displayed at the hospital and also taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.^An attempt at what is said to be the largest jigsaw puzzle on the market was nearly scuppered when four pieces went missing "somewhere in Norfolk".
After centuries as a powerful medieval kingdom, Hungary was part of the Ottoman and then Habsburg empires from the 16th century onwards, emerging as an independent country again after World War I.The Hungarian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric family and is one of the handful of languages spoken within the European Union that are not of Indo-European origin.A landlocked country, Hungary is home to Lake Balaton, the largest in central Europe, and to a large number of spa towns and hot springs.Country profiles compiled by BBC MonitoringIt has especially rich traditions in folk and classical music and was the birthplace of numerous outstanding performers and composers, including Franz Liszt, Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly.Hungary became co-equal partner with Austria in a dual monarchy in the mid-19th century after an unsuccessful revolt against the Habsburgs in 1848. After a period of turmoil following World War I, an independent kingdom of Hungary was established under the authoritarian regency of Admiral Miklos Horthy.The redrawing of European borders that took place after World War I left about five million ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. Their status remains a sensitive issue and has complicated Hungary's relations with its neighbours.Following World War II, in which Admiral Horthy had allied himself with Germany, Hungary fell under communist rule. An uprising in 1956 was crushed by Red Army forces, but Hungary did later become the first Eastern European country to gain some economic freedom.Hungary played an important part in accelerating the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe when it opened its border with Austria in 1989, allowing thousands of East Germans to escape to the West. Just a few months later the Berlin Wall was history.Hungary's post-communist economic transition was achieved relatively smoothly. Within four years of the collapse of communism nearly half of the country's economic enterprises had been transferred to the private sector, and by 1998 Hungary was attracting nearly half of all foreign direct investment in Central Europe.Ten years later, the picture looked rather less rosy. A high level of both private and state borrowing left the country particularly vulnerable to the credit crunch of 2008, and in October of that year the government was forced to appeal to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank for massive loans in a bid to stave off economic collapse.Dissatisfaction with the centre-left coalition government's handling of the economy from 2002 to 2010 coincided with the rise of the right-wing nationalist party Jobbik, known for its anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsy rhetoric, and a move to the authoritarian right by the Fidesz party, which won parliamentary elections in 2010 and 2014.The two-thirds parliamentary majority gained by Fidesz in 2010 allowed it to throw out the comparatively liberal post-communist constitution and replace it with a constitution that critics say cements the governing party's hold on power and removes checks and balances essential for the healthy functioning of a democracy. Fidesz insists that the constitutional change was necessary in order to complete the work of eradicating the legacy of communism.Fidesz scored another comfortable victory in the 2014 election, albeit with a reduced majority. Jobbik increased its share of the vote, becoming the second-largest political party in the country.^Hungary traces its history back to the Magyars, an alliance of semi-nomadic tribes from southern Russia and the Black Sea coast that arrived in the region in the ninth century.
A letter sent by party activists in north Wales claimed Michelle Brown has been "abrasive and discourteous" to them.It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised.But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process.A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a "long-standing grudge" against the AM.The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership.Mr Oakden said: "A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC."Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination."A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: "For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally."Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role.However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a "tiny and insignificant group".In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room.Later that month, she said she had acted "with propriety" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post.Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates.The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil.UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably "too extreme" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to "ostracise" her.Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn.Mr Nuttall resigned after the general election in June when the party failed to win any seats and saw its vote plummet.^A call to deselect a UKIP member of the Welsh assembly has been rejected by the party's ruling body.

As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food.In BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years.She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health.Following a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma.When she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.During an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.Despite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state."I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years," she said."Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health."I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume."I feel so much better and intend to keep this up."The evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing.A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.Plus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.Unfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.This has to change.Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.When we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.But, this can actually make things worse in the long term.The food you are eating is literally "shocking" your body.By changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.She also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.Of course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.As a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:1. Reduce sugar and processed foodsSugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.At this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel "h-angry" as well - hungry and angry.Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.This can have a negative impact on your mood.2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fatsThis is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.Foods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnutsTryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.4. Feed your gut bugsSome scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers.It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.Best options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.You have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.See how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.^Approximately one in four of us will experience a mental health problem each year in England.
Jamal Kiyemba, a Ugandan, was arrested with the the help of US officials in the capital on Tuesday, police added.Prosecutor Joan Kagezi was shot dead on 30 March, a day before the trial of men accused of involvement in bombings.Mr Kiyemba, a former UK resident, was freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006 without being charged with any offence.For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page.He was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 for alleged links with al-Qaeda, and later transferred to the controversial US-run detention centre in Cuba."There was an operation which we carried out with our counter-terrorism team because we suspect that Jamal Kiyemba and his colleagues have been involved in some form of criminality," Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga told Associated Press news agency.There was no conclusive evidence to link him to Ms Kagazi's killing, but he was being questioned about his possible role in her murder and in other crimes, he added.Gunmen on a motorbike shot dead Ms Kagezi in a suburb of Kampala.She was prosecuting 13 men accused of being linked to suicide bombings which killed 76 people in Kampala in 2010.The US deported Mr Kiyemba to Uganda after the UK refused to take him back.He had lived in the UK for eight years before travelling to Pakistan.US President Barack Obama has promised to shut the Guatanamo Bay detention centre because of concerns of widespread human rights abuses.^An ex-Guantanamo Bay detainee has been arrested in Uganda for questioning over his possible role in the killing of a top prosecutor, police say.
The Republican nominee denied ever sexually assaulting women, but turned his fire on ex-President Bill Clinton in a bitter US presidential debate."There's never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women," he said.Hillary Clinton refused to address his comments about her husband.Mr Trump's attack on the Clintons came after moderator Anderson Cooper asked him about a 2005 video released on Friday that revealed Mr Trump bragging about groping women.The 70-year-old billionaire dismissed the remarks as "just words" and "locker room talk".When pressed on whether he had engaged in sexual misconduct, he denied doing so and instead focused on Mr Clinton's previous indiscretions.No criminal charges have been brought against Mr Clinton in any allegations of sexual assault.Mrs Clinton said the explosive video, which has sparked an exodus of Republicans denying support to their presidential nominee, "represents exactly who he is"."With prior Republican nominees, I disagreed with them," she added, "but I never questioned their fitness to serve.When the two took to the stage in St Louis for their second of three debates, they did not shake hands, striking a bitter tone that would continue throughout.Mr Trump said if he won, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton and she would be in prison over her private email arrangements."Everything he just said is absolutely false but I'm not surprised," she responded. "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.""Because you'd be in jail," he interrupted.Mr Trump also said his Democratic rival "has tremendous hate in her heart" while criticising her for referring to his supporters as "deplorables".Mrs Clinton said she apologised for the comment, adding: "My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him, about the hateful and divisive campaign he has run."The two also sparred on the conflict in Syria, Russian aggression, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his plan for the "extreme vetting" of immigrants arriving from countries with links to terrorism.The evening concluded when an audience member asked the candidates to say one positive thing about each other.Mrs Clinton said his children were a great reflection of him while Mr Trump called his opponent "a fighter" who never gives up.An hour before the debate began, Mr Trump appeared at a news conference with women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.He joined three women who allege the former president sexually assaulted them and called the women "very courageous".The Republican was under immense pressure after making obscene comments about women in the video.At least 33 senior Republicans - including senators, members of Congress, and state governors - have withdrawn their support since the video surfaced on Friday.Donald Trump entered this debate threatening to unload every bit of malicious allegations and rumours on Hillary Clinton. And he did.Accusations of Bill Clinton's sexual impropriety? Check. Her work as a public defender representing a rapist? Yup. He even tied it up in a bow by remarking that his Democratic opponent should be in jail.Mrs Clinton said she would take the high road, but she did get in her shots as well, saying the illicit video of Mr Trump's lewd comments showed who he really is.And then, after that nuclear exchange, the debate chugged along - with Mr Trump often gaining the upper hand. If his weakness is policy knowledge, there were few opportunities where his shortcoming were exposed.Instead, there was plenty of time for Mrs Clinton to offer a yet another muddled answer on her email server and essentially confirm that the Wikileaks hacked speech excerpts are accurate. Mr Trump offered word salads in answers about healthcare reform and Syria policy. If anything, from there the debate was a draw.With Mrs Clinton ahead right now, a draw will probably suit her just fine. But it wasn't the knock-out blow her supporters probably hoped for.Who won the debate?Mrs Clinton also defended controversial remarks she made in a private speech that was made public in leaked emails on Saturday.The transcript had revealed she said a politician has a public and private position, but at the debate she said she had watched a film about Abraham Lincoln and was referring only to what he had done.Clinton's Wall Street speeches leakedMr Trump appeared with Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who settled a sexual harassment suit against Mr Clinton for $850,000 in 1999 with no admission of guilt.Juanita Broaddrick, who claimed Mr Clinton raped her in a hotel room in 1978, also appeared with Mr Trump.Mr Clinton has denied the claim through his lawyer and no charges have ever been brought against him.The third woman was Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide who said Mr Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, but had previously said it never happened.Mr Clinton has also denied this claim.Katty Kay:Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who spoke, encountered Mrs Clinton in a criminal case when she was 12 years old.Early in Mrs Clinton's legal career, she was appointed to defend Ms Shelton's rapist, despite objections, and had his sentence reduced to a lesser charge.Years later, an audio tape emerged of Mrs Clinton speaking with a reporter, in which she can be heard laughing about the case.During one instance, she laughed after explaining that her client had passed a lie detector test, which convinced her to never trust them again.How does the US election work?A-Z guide to political jargonKey issues - where candidates standWhy this election will make history^Donald Trump has responded to an outcry over his remarks about groping women by launching a blistering attack against Hillary Clinton and her husband.

Cleverly, 29, will face Braehmer for the WBA regular light-heavyweight belt in Germany on 1 October.The Welshman's three career defeats have all come in his last six bouts."This is a must-win for me - I'm confident I can upset the champion," said Cleverly. "I believe this is my opportunity to turn things around."Cleverly and Braehmer were due to meet in 2011 before an eye injury forced Braehmer to withdraw.The German will be aiming for a seventh successful defence of his title, while Cleverly lost his WBO crown in 2013 when he was stopped by Sergey Kovalev.Asked if this would be his last world title fight if he lost to Braehmer, Cleverly told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "Possibly so and probably so."I knew the world title opportunity would come back around."Sometimes you hit those plateaus - you peak and then have a bit of a flat period. But I think I've got through that and the best is yet to come."The WBA super world light-heavyweight title - the body's top honour in this weight division - is held by Kovalev.Cleverly's last fight was a points defeat by Andrej Fonfara in Chicago in October 2015, though he was encouraged by his performance."We [Cleverly and Braehmer] were meant to fight three times in the past but he never fancied the challenge when I was at the peak of my game and had a lot of hunger and fire," he added."Maybe he's taken the fight now thinking I've had a quiet couple of years and gone off the boil."Maybe he's thinking this is his opportunity to beat me but, as I showed in my last fight, the fire is coming back."I'm looking to become a two-time champion and I'm going to grab it with both hands."It's notoriously difficult for boxers in Germany against the home fighters, but I'm confident that I'm not just going to win, I'm going to win emphatically and take it out of everyone's hands."^Welsh former world champion Nathan Cleverly believes his world title fight against Juergen Braehmer can be a turning point in his career.
A PSNI officer posted on Facebook on Wednesday night that the petrol bombs had been found in Colinview Street and were designed to be thrown at officers.They said it followed an incident at Lanark Way earlier this week when a petrol bomb was thrown at police as they stood among a crowd of people including young children.It did not ignite and fell on ground.The police officer described the petrol bomb attack as "sheer recklessness"."Why do some people think it's acceptable to throw items such as this at another human being?," the post said.The police officer added that the 16 petrol bombs had been stashed in Colinview Street "to be thrown at officers again"."Have a think about what you are doing engaging in this type of behaviour, it can't be stressed enough how dangerous this is," the PSNI officer said."Are we really promoting a society where people are effectively trying to set light to police officers at their day's work?"^Police seized 16 petrol bombs in west Belfast after one was thrown at officers in the area earlier this week.
The Friends of Sherwood Forest say the Â£5.3m centre, located on the edge of a country park, will devastate the area."It has all sorts of wildlife - insect life and newts," the charity's group spokesman Adrian Wilson said.Nottinghamshire County Council said the new site would "balance the interests" of the community and visitors.The current centre is in Sherwood Forest Country Park, on land designated as a site of special scientific interest but plans are to move it to Forest Corner, on grassland on the edge of the park.The council has signed a contract with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) to build and run a new one.County council spokesman Derek Higton said: "The centre will be run by one of the world's leading conservation organisations - and that's why we partnered with them."Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire"We are confident we can balance the interests of the community and the interests of the 350,000 people who visit Sherwood Forest and Major Oak every year."Detailed plans have not yet been submitted.Mr Wilson said: "It is priceless - if you were to drive up the road, on a Sunday lunchtime, you would see the cricketers out here all in their whites, people sat round watching the cricket match."You get that feeling straight way - this is England."Shawn and Linda Geery, who walk their dog in the country park, said: "It is too near the edge of the forest, the parking problems will be horrendous."Construction is scheduled to start in December 2016 with the opening expected by winter 2017.^A new visitors' centre proposed for Sherwood Forest will ruin "a priceless" tract of land and threaten wildlife, opponents say.
The Pirates of the Caribbean star will play the title role in Therese Raquin, based on Emile Zola's 1867 classic.Described as "a tale of love, lust, betrayal, and guilt," the play will cast her as a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage who has an affair with one of her husband's friends.The Roundabout Theatre Company show opens in October 2015 in New York.Knightley, who turns 30 next year, previously trod the boards in London in The Misanthrope and The Children's Hour.The actress has two films out next month in the UK - World War Two drama The Imitation Game and US comedy Say When.Therese Raquin has been staged and filmed many times, most recently as the film In Secret starring Elizabeth Olsen.The new version is by British playwright Helen Edmundson, who previously adapted the Tolstoy novels Anna Karenina and War and Peace for the stage.Knightley appeared in a 2012 film of Anna Karenina and has also appeared in film adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Ian McEwan's Atonement.Therese Raquin begins previews on 1 October and has its opening night on 29 October at a Broadway theatre yet to be announced.Earlier this year Knightley revealed she had hoped to take The Children's Hour to Broadway but could not work out the scheduling with co-star Elisabeth Moss."We tried to make it happen, but our scheduling didn't work out," she told The Advocate. "It was a real shame, because it would be great doing it on Broadway."^British actress Keira Knightley is to make her Broadway debut next year in a stage version of a famous French novel.
In an unexpected move, Greece's culture minister said the country would pursue a "diplomatic and political" approach to retrieving the sculptures instead.In doing so, the country has rejected the advice of barrister Amal Clooney, who had urged Greece to take Britain to the International Criminal Court.The Marbles were taken from Greece's Parthenon by Lord Elgin 200 years ago.Greece insists the Parthenon Sculptures - as they are properly known - were taken illegally and has pursued a high-profile campaign in recent years for their return, latterly with the help of Mrs Clooney.Mrs Clooney reportedly submitted a 150-page report to the Greek government this week urging it to formally request the repatriation of the marbles and take Britain to the International Criminal Court if it refused.But Greece's culture minister Nikos Xydakis told the country's Mega TV: "One cannot go to court over whatever issue. Besides, in international courts the outcome is uncertain".He said he believed attitudes to the future of the Marbles were slowly changing and would favour Greece in a diplomatic approach.For 30 years, Athens has been locked in a bitter dispute over its demand for the marbles to be returned.The British Museum recently turned down a proposal by UNESCO, the UN cultural agency, to mediate in the dispute. Mr Xydakis condemned the refusal, accusing Britain of "negativism" and a "lack of respect".In December, the museum loaned one of the marbles for the first time to Russia for a display in St Petersburg's State Hermitage Museum.The Greek Prime Minister at the time, Antonis Samaras, said the museum's decision was "an affront" to the Greek people.^Greece has ruled out taking legal action against the UK to reclaim the Elgin Marbles from the British Museum.

I couldn't cope with it any more."Mr Clarke denies 17 charges of indecent assault, 12 offences of indecency with a child and two attempted serious sexual offences.The trial continues.^A 101-year-old man accused of child sex offences was described as a "monster" by an alleged victim.

Labour's new leader said he wanted the weekly sessions to be less "theatrical" and Mr Cameron agreed there should be more focus on "substantial issues".Mr Corbyn asked about housing, tax credits and mental health service cuts.The BBC's Norman Smith said it was much calmer than normal but the PM had not been put under any real pressure.Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg later on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted he would not campaign for the UK to leave the European Union, while vowing to fight any moves towards a more free-market relationship.Mr Corbyn was cheered by Labour MPs as he got to his feet at his first PMQs, before launching into a lengthy pre-amble in which he thanked supporters for his Labour leadership victory, vowed to make PMQs less "theatrical" and explained his decision to crowd source his questions.He said: "I thought at my first PMQs, I would do it in a slightly different way... So I sent out an email to thousands of people and asked them what questions they would like to put to the prime minister and I received 40,000 replies."The prime minster congratulated Mr Corbyn on his "resounding victory" in the Labour leadership contest and welcomed him to the frontbench.Mr Cameron, who began his own career as opposition leader in 2005 promising to end "Punch and Judy" politics, then said "no one would be more delighted than me" if PMQs could become a "genuine exercise in asking questions and answering questions".Mr Corbyn's first question "from a woman called Marie" was on the "chronic lack of affordable housing" and "the extortionate rents charged by some private sector landlords" - something the new Labour leader has said will be his top priority.Mr Cameron said the government had delivered more affordable homes but recognised "much more needs to be done".Before Mr Corbyn began his second question, on job losses at housing associations, he thanked the prime minister "for his commitment that we are going to do Prime Minister's Questions in a more adult way than it's been done in the past".He then asked about "absolutely shameful" cuts to tax credits voted through by MPs on Tuesday, on behalf of  "Paul," and about cuts to mental health services, prompted by a question from "Gail".BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's verdictAs promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit, no where to be seen.  It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions.What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs, the new Labour leader's first ever outing at the despatch box.Read Laura's full analysisMr Cameron struck a consensual tone in his replies, agreeing that more needed to be done to improve mental health services, and paused to scold Labour MPs who were jeering him over his claim that the lowest paid would be Â£20 a week better off next year thanks to an increase in the minimum wage."I thought this was the new Question Time. I'm not sure the message has fully got home," he told them.The prime minister took a couple of swipes at the new Labour leader when answering questions from backbenchers, as noise levels in the chamber returned to normal levels, although Tory MPs still appeared to be following instructions to avoid triumphalism.In response to a question on Northern Ireland from DUP MP Nigel Dodds, Mr Cameron paid tribute to former Conservative MPs Airey Neave and Ian Gow, who were murdered by Republican terrorists.He did not directly refer to controversy over Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell's previous comments on Northern Ireland, but said: "I have a simple view, which is the terrorism we faced was wrong, it was unjustifiable, the death and the killing was wrong. It was never justified and people who seek to justify it should be ashamed of themselves."He held back from attacking Mr Corbyn over his much-criticised decision not to sing the national anthem at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, saying in response to a question from a Tory MP that the St Paul's Cathedral event had been "a reminder of how proud we should be of our armed forces, then, today and always."Minutes before the session began Labour sources confirmed that their leader, who believes in the abolition of the monarchy, would join in with the anthem at future official engagements.Labour denied that Mr Corbyn's new approach - asking six different questions rather than pushing the prime minister on a single point - gave Mr Cameron an easy ride."The questions were very direct and they demanded clear answers," a Labour source said.Asked about policy differences that appear to have emerged between Mr Corbyn and his front bench, on welfare cuts and Europe, a Labour source said "lots of listening" would be done and some policies would be reviewed under the new leadership.^Jeremy Corbyn asked David Cameron questions emailed to him from the public as he tried what he called "a different" style for his debut PMQs.
